Imagine you are new to the working environment, and you have decided to apply for a job at Sam's Scoops within their cyber security department. An area you have had a deep interest in after experiencing an attempted cybercrime yourself! As a fresh-faced graduate, you are hoping to show your knowledge by nailing the cyber-security questions in the interview. The following are a sample of the questions that have been asked in the interview.

1.  Question 1
    Sam's Scoops requires your consultation in relation to moving from an on-premises Active Directory (AD) to a completely cloud-based one. They hope to bring some international individuals with lucrative offers and allow them use of company hardware to access the system.

To ensure the security of their operation, what measures should be taken with these devices to ensure the best security for a cloud-based operation?

- **Ensure that all the devices are joined devices.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Any devices that are owned by the corporation should be joined to the system. The devices would use a corporate ID existing on Azure AD.
- Ensure that all the devices are hybrid joined devices.
- Ensure all the devices are registered with the AD.

2. Question 2
   Samâ€™s Scoops would like to ensure a seamless yet safe authentication when accessing their system. They have considered different authentication strategies and have settled on a passwordless approach for the best, yet most secure, means of authentication.

Which of the following would most accurately reflect their approach?

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- **Microsoft Authenticator**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Microsoft Authenticator can be configured to enter a prompted number into the app. This sign-on does not require a username or password
- Use of hardware tokens to authenticate

3. Question 3
   Sam's Scoops would like you to secure access to a sample database. As you may be aware, role-based access control (RBAC) is seen as a strong method for implementing secure access management policies. But how would you complete secure access to a sample database that is to be used by the finance division?

Which of the following would you apply an RBAC policy on?

- **Apply it to a group.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Best practices with access management advocate for creating a group and populating it with all members from the finance division who should have access to the database. This aligns with the ease of application of the access lifecycle on the employees.
- Apply it to the privileged members of the division.
- Apply it to individual users.
