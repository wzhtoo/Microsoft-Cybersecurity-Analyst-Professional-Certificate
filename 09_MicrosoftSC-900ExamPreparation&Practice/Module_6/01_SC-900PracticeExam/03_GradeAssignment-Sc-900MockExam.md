  - Thatâ€™s correct! The systematic order "Policy, Alerts, Triage, Investigate, Action" in the context of Microsoft's workflow for Insider risk management aligns with the typical progression of actions in addressing potential insider threats. It starts with establishing policies defining the rules and criteria for identifying risky behavior. Subsequently, the system generates alerts based on these policies, signaling potential issues. The Triage phase involves prioritizing and categorizing alerts for further investigation. The investigative phase delves deeper into the flagged incidents to assess their severity and validity. Finally, the Action phase involves taking appropriate measures, such as implementing security controls, disciplinary actions, or refining policies based on the insights gained during the investigation
