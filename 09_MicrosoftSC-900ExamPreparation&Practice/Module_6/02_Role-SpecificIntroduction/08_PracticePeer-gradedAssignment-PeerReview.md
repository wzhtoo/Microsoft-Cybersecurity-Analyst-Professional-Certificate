1.  Question 1
    What is the main advantage of applying trend analysis to log files?

- Reducing the size of log files to save storage space.
- **Predicting load spikes and potential system outages.**
  - That's correct. Trend analysis uses historical data to forecast future behavior, enabling preemptive actions to mitigate risks
- Detecting deviations from baseline behaviors in real-time.
- Identifying the source of an error by linking related log entries.

2. Question 2
   Fill in the blank: Generative AI can forecast potential failures and suggest maintenance before problems occur by analyzing **\_\_\_\_** and real-time log data.

- fragmented
- encrypted
- irrelevant
- **historical**
  - That's correct. By analyzing historical and real-time log data, generative AI can predict potential failures and suggest preemptive maintenance.

3. Question 3
   Which of the following is a key benefit of employing generative AI for security log analysis?

- Ignoring anomalous patterns
- **Automated classification of log data**
  - That's correct. Generative AI can categorize events into normal operations, suspicious activities, and definite threats, aiding in prioritizing alerts.
- Manual review of all log entries
- Increased log file sizes

4. Question 4
   Which of the following are the limitations of using generative AI in security log analysis? Select all that apply.

- **Vulnerability to adversarial attacks**
  - That's correct. Skilled attackers can exploit AI models, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
- Instantaneous threat elimination
- **Dependence on quality and quantity of data**
  - That's correct. Generative AI models are only as effective as the data they are trained on
- Increased manual intervention is required

5. Question 5
   Generative AI can enhance cybersecurity by \***\*\_\_\*\*** the detection of password attacks, therefore improving response times.

- encrypting
- complicating
- **automating**
  - That's correct. Generative AI automates the detection of password attacks, improving response times.
- delaying

6. Question 6
   Fill in the blank: Generative AI helps detect credential stuffing attacks by analyzing \***\*\_\_\*\***.

- access times
- firewall rules
- **login attempt patterns**
  - That's correct. Generative AI analyzes login attempt patterns to detect credential stuffing attacks.
- IP address lists

7. Question 7
   Which of the following are steps in leveraging generative AI to detect DDoS attacks? Select all that apply.

Manually inspecting each log file for signs of attack.

- **Comparing incoming log data with generated synthetic logs to detect anomalies.**
  - That's correct. Comparing actual logs with synthetic logs helps detect deviations that may indicate a DDoS attack.
- **Data preprocessing to normalize logs from various sources.**
  - That's correct. Data preprocessing ensures logs are in a consistent format for analysis.
- **Training models with historical log data including known DDoS attack instances.**
  - That's correct. Training with historical data helps the models learn to identify anomalies.

8. Question 8
   A security analyst notices a significant increase in failed login attempts from a single IP address within a short period. What should be their primary course of action?

- **Investigate the IP address for a potential DDoS attack.**
  - That's correct. A significant increase in failed login attempts from a single IP address is a potential sign of a DDoS attack and should be investigated.
- Ignore the issue as it might resolve itself.
- Immediately block the IP address to prevent further login attempts.
- Increase the login attempt threshold for that IP address.

9. Question 9
   A security analyst observes URL requests attempting to access /etc/passwd followed by command execution attempts. What should they conclude?

- It suggests that an employee has forgotten their password.
- It indicates a benign system update.
- It is normal behavior for system logs.
- **It is likely a multi-stage directory traversal attack.**
  - That's correct. This pattern suggests a multi-stage attack combining directory traversal with command execution.

10. Question 10
    Fill in the blank: Directory traversal attacks involve manipulating \***\*\_\_\*\*** to access files that are not intended to be accessible.

- network protocols
- user credentials
- **file paths**
  - That's correct. Directory traversal attacks manipulate file paths to access unauthorized files.
- localhost
