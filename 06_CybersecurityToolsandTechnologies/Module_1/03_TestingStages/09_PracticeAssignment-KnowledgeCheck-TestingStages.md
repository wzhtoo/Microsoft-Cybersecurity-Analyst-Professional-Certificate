1.  Question 1
    Which of the below represents the first stage of the penetration testing process?

- Escalation
- Enumeration
- **Reconnaissance**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The first stage of penetration testing is reconnaissance. During this stage, ethical hackers gather information about the target organization, including network architecture, system configurations, and potential entry points.
- Reporting and remediation

2. Question 2
   Which stage involves actively probing the target system to identify open ports, services, and user accounts?

- Exploitation
- **Enumeration**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Enumeration involves actively probing the target system. Testers identify open ports, services, and user accounts to gain a deeper understanding of the target environment.
- Reporting and remediation
- Escalation

3. Question 3
   In which stage of penetration testing do testers gain administrative access and move laterally within the network?

- **Escalation**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The stage where testers gain administrative access and move laterally within the network is called escalation. It simulates an attacker's actions after gaining initial unauthorized access to the system.
- Reporting and remediation
- Enumeration
- Exploitation

4. Question 4
   Sam's Scoops wants to ensure the security of its customer transactions and personal information. They decide to conduct a penetration test to identify vulnerabilities in their system. During the testing process, the ethical hackers have successfully gained unauthorized access to Sam's Scoops' network and systems.

- What is the next stage in the penetration testing process?
- Reporting and Remediation
- Reconnaissance
- **Escalation**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Once the ethical hackers have gained unauthorized access to Sam's Scoops' network and systems, the next stage is escalation. In this stage, they escalate their privileges to gain administrative access and move freely within the network, mimicking an attacker's actions.
- Enumeration

5. Question 5
   You have four stages of the penetration testing process for Samâ€™s Scoops complete. Which of the following stages generates a comprehensive report that identifies vulnerabilities and recommends remediation steps for Sam?

- Escalation
- **Reporting and remediation**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The stage where a comprehensive report is generated with identified vulnerabilities and recommended remediation steps is called reporting and remediation. This report helps organizations prioritize and address the identified issues effectively.
- Exploitation
- Reconnaissance
