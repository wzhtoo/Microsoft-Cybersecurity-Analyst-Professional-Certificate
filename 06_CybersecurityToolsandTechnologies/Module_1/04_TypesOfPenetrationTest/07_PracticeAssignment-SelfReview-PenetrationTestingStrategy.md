## Assignment

[Assignment ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-tools-and-technologies/assignment-submission/6ens3/self-review-penetration-testing-strategy/attempt)

In the exercise, you demonstrated your skills in developing a comprehensive penetration testing strategy to enhance the security of Sam's Scoops. You carefully planned tasks for each stage of the penetration testing process, considering tools, techniques, and testing types.

Now let's assess your understanding and application of the concepts covered through a self-review quiz.

1.  Question 1
    What is the purpose of the reconnaissance phase in this exercise?

- To collect information about Sam's Scoops and its infrastructure.
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The purpose of the reconnaissance phase is to collect information about Sam's Scoops and their infrastructure. This information can be used to identify potential attack vectors and to plan the attack.
- To gather information about the target VMs' vulnerabilities.
- To scan the target VMs for open ports and services.

2. Question 2
   What is the goal of the exploitation phase in this exercise?

- To gain access by exploiting vulnerabilities
- **To identify misconfigurations in the Azure Firewall.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The goal of the exploitation phase is to utilize suitable methods and techniques to exploit the identified vulnerabilities.
- Attempt privilege escalation techniques to gain administrator or root access.

3. Question 3
   Based on your understanding of the case study, which testing methodology did you recommend for participants?

- **White box testing**
  - That's great. White box testing is a type of penetration testing where the tester has full knowledge of the target system. This allows the tester to exploit vulnerabilities that would not be possible to exploit in a black box or grey box testing environment.
- Compliance testing
- Grey box testing
- Black box testing
