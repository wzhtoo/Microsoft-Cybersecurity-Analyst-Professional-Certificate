1.  Question 1
    A company recently launched an online ordering feature on its website. Whatâ€™s the purpose of using black box testing to test this feature?

- Reviewing the source code line by line to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Simulating real-world attack scenarios without any prior knowledge of the system's vulnerabilities.
- **Testing the functionality of the system from an external perspective.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Black box testing focuses on evaluating the functionality of the system without any knowledge of its internal workings.
- Analyzing the internal components of the software, such as algorithms and data structures, to check for vulnerabilities.

2. Question 2
   Which of the following vulnerabilities can be identified through black box testing for an eCommerce website?

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Black box testing can help identify Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Analysis of the source code.
- White box testing flaws.
- Improperly configured systems.

3. Question 3
   What is the primary advantage of white box testing?

- It simulates real-world attack scenarios without prior knowledge of the system's vulnerabilities.
- It involves reviewing the source code without executing it.
- **Testers have access to the internal structure, design, and code of the system.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. In white box testing, testers have access to the internal structure, design, and code of the system.
- It focuses on testing the system from a user's perspective.

4. Question 4
   Which approach is used in white box testing to ensure all parts of the code are exercised during testing?

- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Unit testing
- Code coverage analysis
- **Branch testing**

5. Question 5
   True or false: Ally wants to ensure that her applications are secure at the source code level. This means that tester requires access to the app architecture and design, as well as the source code.

Grey box testing is ideal because it provides the required access needed to complete the test.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Grey box testing does not provide testers with complete knowledge of the system's internals. White box testing would be better suited to test Allyâ€™s application
