1.  Question 1
    What is the primary goal of red teaming?

- Assess and improve defensive security measures directly.
- **Simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities in a system's security.**
  - That's correct. The red team takes on the role of attackers and tries to breach the system to uncover weaknesses that need to be addressed.
- Protect the organization's critical assets against any kind of threat.

2. Question 2
   Which of the following are responsibilities of the blue team? Select all that apply.

- **Vulnerability scanning**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Vulnerability scanning is one of the primary responsibilities of the blue team.
- **Intrusion detection**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Intrusion detection is also one of the primary responsibilities of the blue team.
- **Collaborating with other teams**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Collaboration with other teams, such as the incident response team and IT department, is an important responsibility of the blue team.
- **Network monitoring**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Network monitoring is one of the primary responsibilities of the blue team.
- Conducting ethical hacking exercises

3. Question 3
   True or False: The red team's objective is to defend an organization's digital assets and protect against threats.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The Red team's objective is to understand vulnerabilities and weaknesses in an organization's defenses by mimicking real-world attackers, not to defend the organization's assets.

4. Question 4
   What is the purpose of the enumeration stage in penetration testing?

- Identifying vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors.
- **Gathering information about the target system.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The enumeration stage in penetration testing is focused on gathering more specific information about the target system, such as open ports and services, operating system versions, and user accounts.
- Reporting the findings and recommendations.
- Exploiting software vulnerabilities.

5. Question 5
   What is the final stage of the penetration testing process?

- Exploitation
- Enumeration
- Reconnaissance
- **Reporting and remediation**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The final stage of the penetration testing process is reporting and remediation, where the testers document their findings and provide recommendations.

6. Question 6
   True or False: The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques maintained by a non-profit organization called MITRE.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is indeed a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques maintained by MITRE, a non-profit organization with expertise in security, systems engineering, and information technology.
- False

7. Question 7
   What does black box testing focus on?

- **Inputs and outputs without knowledge of internal workings.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Black box testing involves treating the system as a black box and focusing solely on its inputs and outputs without having any knowledge of its internal workings.
- Manipulating the inputs.
- Internal code and structure.
- System requirements and functionalities.

8. Question 8
   Which of the following take place in white box testing? Select all that apply.

- **Source code review**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Source code review includes analyzing the code line by line to identify potential vulnerabilities and logic errors.
- **Code coverage analysis**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Code coverage analysis ensures that all parts of the code are exercised during testing.
- **Path testing**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Path testing aims to analyze different execution paths within the software.
- User acceptance testing

9. Question 9
   Grey box testing provides a \***\*\_\_\_\*\*** approach to testing, allowing testers to make educated guesses and decisions about where to focus their testing efforts.

- Random
- Complete
- Limited
- **Balanced**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Grey box testing provides a balanced approach, allowing testers to make educated guesses and decisions about where to focus their testing efforts

10. Question 10
    Which of the following are key compliance features offered by Azure? Select all that apply.

- **Data encryption**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Azure offers robust encryption mechanisms to protect data at rest and in transit.
- Cost management
- **Access controls**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Azure provides granular access controls and identity management through Azure Active Directory.
- Performance optimization
