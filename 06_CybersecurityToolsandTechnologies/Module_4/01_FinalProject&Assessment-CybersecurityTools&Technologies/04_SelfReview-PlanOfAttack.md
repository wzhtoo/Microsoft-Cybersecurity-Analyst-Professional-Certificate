[Assignment ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-tools-and-technologies/assignment-submission/Aw4Y8/self-review-plan-of-attack/attempt)

Congratulations on completing the Plan of attack course project, where you formulated a complete penetration testing plan and developed a network architecture diagram for Sam's Scoops. Now it's time to reflect on your application of key skills and concepts throughout the exercise. This self-review quiz will assess your understanding of the key concepts and how effectively you applied them to complete the exercise.

1.  Question 1
    When conducting a penetration test, which of the below represents the initial phase of the test?

- Enumeration
- **Reconnaissance**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Reconnaissance is the initial phase where information is gathered before testing begins.
- Escalation
- Exploitation

2. Question 2
   Which of the following tools is recommended for conducting automated network scanning during the enumeration phase of a penetration test?

- Azure security center
- OWASP Webgoat
- **Nmap**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Nmap is a crucial tool used for automated scanning during the enumeration phase.
- Metasploit

3. Question 3
   During a penetration test, what is the purpose of maintaining access through backdoors or persistent scripts?

- To demonstrate data security risks.
- **To ensure continued access for further testing.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Maintaining access through backdoors or persistent scripts ensures continued access for further testing.
- To exploit vulnerabilities.
- To escalate privileges.

4. Question 4
   What is the importance of a Network Architecture Diagram in a penetration testing plan?

- It shows the timeline for conducting the test.
- It lists all vulnerabilities found during testing.
- **It provides a visual representation of the network structure.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. A Network Architecture Diagram provides a visual representation of the network structure.
- It outlines the legal and compliance considerations.

5. Question 5
   What is the purpose of a debriefing session with stakeholders after penetration testing?

- To celebrate the successful completion of testing.
- To obtain permission to conduct the penetration test.
- **To discuss findings, remediation plans, and lessons learned.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The debriefing session is held to discuss findings, remediation plans, and lessons learned.
- To escalate identified vulnerabilities to senior management.

6. Question 6
   In the context of penetration testing, what is the primary goal of the exploitation phase?

- **To escalate privileges on the target system.**
- To develop security policies.
- To gather information about Azure resources.
- To identify vulnerabilities in the target system.

7. Question 7
   What should be the focus when prioritizing vulnerabilities in a penetration testing report?

- The order in which they were discovered.
- **Their criticality, potential impact, and exploitability.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Prioritizing should consider criticality, potential impact, and exploitability of vulnerabilities.
- The complexity of remediation steps.
- The number of vulnerabilities identified.

8. Question 8
   What is the purpose of the Rules of Engagement in a penetration testing plan?

- To obtain legal and regulatory approvals.
- To escalate identified vulnerabilities to senior management.
- **To define the scope, testing hours, and limitations of the test.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Rules of Engagement define the scope, testing hours, and limitations of the penetration test.
- To celebrate the successful completion of testing.

9. Question 9
   When conducting a penetration test, what is considered the primary goal of the escalation phase?

- To conduct ethical hacking principles.
- To exploit vulnerabilities.
- To maintain access through backdoors or persistent scripts.
- **To escalate privileges on the target system.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The escalation phase aims to escalate privileges on the target system.

10. Question 10
    What is the purpose of the Communication Plan in a penetration testing project?

- **To establish communication channels for reporting progress and findings.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The Communication Plan ensures effective reporting and updates during the penetration test
- To obtain permission to conduct the penetration test.
- To prioritize vulnerabilities.
- To develop security policies.
