1.  Question 1
    What is the primary function of an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)?

- To provide wireless connectivity for devices.
- To manage and configure network devices.
- **To monitor and safeguard networks from unauthorized access and malicious activities.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The primary function of an IDPS is to monitor and safeguard networks from unauthorized access, misuse, and malicious activities. It plays a vital role in network security.
- To analyze and optimize network traffic.

2. Question 2
   True or False: IDPS can only detect and alert security personnel about potential intrusions, but it cannot prevent them.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. IDPS can detect and prevent potential intrusions through various techniques and actions.

3. Question 3
   True or False: IDPS only uses signature-based detection to identify potential threats.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. IDPS uses various detection techniques, including signature-based, anomaly-based, and behavior-based detection, to identify potential threats.

4. Question 4
   What is the primary purpose of firewall design in Microsoft Azure?

- To enable unauthorized access to resources and data.
- To ensure high availability and disaster recovery for resources.
- To simplify management of security measures by using human errors.
- **To protect valuable resources from unauthorized access and cyber threats.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The primary purpose of firewall design in Microsoft Azure is to protect valuable resources from unauthorized access and various cyber threats.

5. Question 5
   What are some benefits of using the hub and spoke network topology in Azure?

- It eliminates the need for network security groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall.
- **It provides better control, security, and traffic monitoring by funneling all traffic through the hub.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. the hub and spoke network topology provide better control, security, and traffic monitoring by funneling all traffic through the central hub.
- It allows for direct communication between virtual networks without any routing.
- It is suitable for small-scale deployments but not recommended for large-scale Azure environments.

6. Question 6
   You're architecting a network infrastructure in Microsoft Azure to ensure efficient communication between virtual networks. Considering the available options, which network topology facilitates direct communication between virtual networks?

- Single virtual network
- Azure Firewall with private endpoints
- Hub and spoke
- **Virtual network peering**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Virtual Network Peering enables direct communication between virtual networks, facilitating resource sharing while maintaining isolation and control between the interconnected networks.

7. Question 7
   What is the primary purpose of a virtual network gateway in Azure?

- To serve as a dedicated, private connection between on-premises networks and Azure services.
- **To provide a managed VPN solution for secure communication between on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks.**
  - That's correct. A virtual network gateway in Azure facilitates secure communication between on-premises networks and Azure virtual networks through VPN connections.
- To create virtual network connections within Azure for efficient sharing of data.

8. Question 8
   True or False: Vulnerability management is a proactive approach to cybersecurity, encompassing the process of identifying, assessing, mitigating, and managing security vulnerabilities within an organization's IT infrastructure.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Vulnerability management involves taking proactive steps to address potential security vulnerabilities.
- False

9. Question 9
   You're working as a cybersecurity analyst for a tech company. As part of your role, you're exploring strategies to enhance your organization's security posture. One strategy involves making specific adjustments to system settings and parameters in accordance with established best practices. This approach aims to minimize potential points of exploitation. What is this strategy commonly referred to as?

- Applying patches and updates.
- Ignoring vulnerabilities.
- Conducting regular vulnerability scans.
- **Configuration changes.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Adjusting configurations based on best practices is an effective strategy to address vulnerabilities.

10. Question 10
    True or False: Configuration vulnerabilities are a result of programming errors in software applications.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Configuration vulnerabilities arise from incorrect or inadequate configurations, not programming errors.
