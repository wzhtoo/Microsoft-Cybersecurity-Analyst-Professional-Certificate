1.  Question 1
    You've been hired to assess Samâ€™s Scoops current IT infrastructure and recommend improvements to ensure the security of customer data. You decide to utilize both the Command Line Interface (CLI) and PowerShell to address the IT needs.

What's a key advantage of using the CLI in penetration testing for Samâ€™s Scoops?

- **It allows testers to execute commands rapidly and precisely.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The CLI enables testers to execute commands quickly and precisely, enhancing efficiency in penetration testing.
- It provides a graphical interface for easy navigation.
- It doesn't support automation.
- It consumes more system resources compared to GUI.

2. Question 2
   Sarah, an Azure administrator, wants to perform penetration testing to assess the security of their Azure environment. She is aware of the rules of engagement and best practices for penetration testing in Azure. She has gathered the necessary permissions, documented assets in scope, and is ready to run vulnerability scanning tools. However, she receives an email that appears to be from Microsoft, asking her to provide her Azure login credentials for a "security audit."

What should Sarah do in this situation?

- Click on the link in the email and provide her Azure login credentials as requested.

- **Forward the email to internal company's security team for verification and avoid clicking on any links.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Sarah should forward the email to her company's internal security team to verify its legitimacy and avoid clicking on any links that could pose security risks.
- Reply to the email with her login credentials to expedite the security audit process.
- Ignore the email and continue with her penetration testing as planned.

3. Question 3
   True or False: Offensive techniques in penetration testing are designed to identify vulnerabilities and potential security gaps within a target environment.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Offensive techniques aim to identify vulnerabilities and potential security gaps
- False

4. Question 4
   True or False: Azure penetration testing is a one-time process that does not require ongoing assessment and improvement.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Azure penetration testing is an ongoing and iterative process to ensure ongoing security.

5. Question 5
   John is responsible for configuring Azure resources for penetration testing. He wants to create an Automation account for testing purposes.

What should John do based on the scenario? Select all that apply.

- Create an Automation account using his regular user account (non-administrator account).
- **Proceed to create an Automation account tailored to the requirements of penetration testing.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. John should create an Automation account customized for penetration testing.
- **Seek approval from the internal security team before creating an Automation account.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. John should consider seeking approval from the internal security team before proceeding.
- Create an Automation account with identical settings as a production account.

6. Question 6
   What is the primary function of the Penetration Testing Execution Standard, or PTES?

- To develop software applications.
- To conduct network monitoring.
- To design secure encryption algorithms.
- **To provide a structured approach for vulnerability assessment.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. PTES is designed to provide a structured approach for vulnerability assessment.

7. Question 7
   True or False: After creating a runbook, you need to input your penetration testing commands or scripts using templates or runbooks within the runbook itself. Further configuration and scripting are required to perform the tests.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Additional configuration and scripting may be required to execute the tests effectively.
- False

8. Question 8
   What is the main objective of creating a runbook in Azure Automation for conducting penetration tests?

- To optimize Azure resource performance.
- To automate ice cream production processes.
- **To define the specific steps and actions for penetration testing.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Creating a runbook in Azure Automation is to define the specific steps and actions required for conducting penetration tests.
- To streamline the creation of Azure Automation accounts.

9. Question 9
   What is the first step in web application penetration testing using Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell?

- Scripting fixes for vulnerabilities.
- Analyzing security headers.
- Running penetration tests on web forms.
- **Mapping out the attack surface of the web applications.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The first step is understanding the attack surface by gathering information about the applications.

10. Question 10
    What does the az login command do in Azure CLI?

- It lists all Azure subscriptions in the account.
- **It initiates a login process to the Azure environment.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The az login command initiates a login process where users enter their Microsoft admin credentials to sign in to Azure.
- It creates a new Azure subscription.
- It creates a new resource group.
