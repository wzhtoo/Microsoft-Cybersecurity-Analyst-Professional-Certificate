  - That's correct! Azure DDoS Protection is a service provided by Microsoft Azure that protects against DDoS attacks by monitoring traffic patterns and automatically blocking malicious traffic, so that the website or online services remain up and running.

- A tool that hides the IP address of a website or app
- A tool that automatically backs up data in case of data loss or corruption

3. Question 3
   What is a web application firewall?

- A Firewall that filters traffic to a website or app based on IP address
- **A Firewall that provides extra security by filtering out malicious traffic and requests**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A web application firewall (WAF) is a tool that provides an additional layer of security for websites and applications, by analyzing incoming traffic and filtering out malicious requests.
- A Firewall that encrypts website or app data
- A Firewall that accelerates website or app loading times

4. Question 4
   What is the difference between DDoS IP Protection and DDoS Network Protection?

- **DDoS IP Protection can protect any public IP resource without needing a separate protection plan, while DDoS Network Protection can protect multiple subscriptions with just one protection plan**

  - Thatâ€™s correct! DDOS IP protection is used to protect a public IP resource without a separate protection plan and DDoS Network Protection can protect multiple subscriptions with only one plan.

- DDoS IP Protection can protect public IP Basic SKU, while DDoS Network Protection cannot Not quite. Inverse is true, DDoS IP Protection cannot protect public IP Basic SKU, while DDoS Network Protection can.
- DDoS Network Protection and DDoS IP Protection can protect all PaaS services
- DDoS Network Protection can protect any public IP resource without needing a separate protection plan, while DDoS IP Protection can protect multiple subscriptions with just one protection plan

5. Question 5
   What are the limitations of DDoS Network Protection and DDoS IP Protection?

- **DDoS Network Protection can protect public IP Basic SKU, but DDoS IP Protection canâ€™t**

  - Thatâ€™s correct! DDoS IP Protection does not protect public IP Basic SKU, a type of public IP address that provides a basic level of DDoS protection, but DDoS Network Protection does.

- DDoS IP Protection and DDoS Network Protection can protect all PaaS ervices
- DDoS IP Protection and DDoS Network Protection can protect all public IP address SKUs
