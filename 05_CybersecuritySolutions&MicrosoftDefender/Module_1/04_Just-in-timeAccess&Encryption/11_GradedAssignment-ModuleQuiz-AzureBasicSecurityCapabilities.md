1.  Question 1
    Which benefit does Azure DDoS Network Protection provide to a virtual network?

- **Dedicated monitoring and detection of malicious traffic patterns**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! DDoS Network Protection provides ongoing monitoring and malicious traffic detection for networks.
- Automatic backup of network settings
- Traffic management across multiple Azure subscriptions
- Automated data encryption for all network data

2. Question 2
   Which Azure Firewall SKU offers the highest level of security features for sensitive applications, such as advanced threat protection?

- Essential
- Basic
- Standard
- **Premium**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The Premium SKU includes advanced threat protection and other features essential for securing sensitive applications.

3. Question 3
   Which Azure feature minimizes exposure by allowing temporary, on-demand access to virtual machines?

- **Just-in-time (JIT) access**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! JIT access provides temporary, controlled access to VMs, enhancing security by reducing exposure.
- Azure Bastion
- Network security groups (NSGs)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

4. Question 4
   What type of Azure Firewall rule would you use to manage traffic between specified IP addresses?

- NAT rule
- **Network rule**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Network rules manage traffic flow based on IP addresses and ports.
- Application rule
- Threat intelligence rule

5. Question 5
   How does Azure DDoS Protectionâ€™s adaptive traffic monitoring enhance threat detection?

- It routes all traffic through a VPN before reaching applications
- **It learns typical traffic patterns to quickly identify unusual spikes that may signal an attack**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Adaptive traffic monitoring allows DDoS protection to detect abnormal traffic patterns efficiently
- It provides real-time alerts based on manual thresholds set by administrators
- It filters data by encryption level

6. Question 6
   What support does the Azure DDoS Rapid Response team provide during an active DDoS attack?

- Providing firewall upgrade recommendations
- **Investigation and assistance in mitigating the attack**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The DDoS Rapid Response team aids in analyzing and mitigating DDoS attacks.
- Rebuilding affected applications
- Adding extra public IP resources for protection

7. Question 7
   Which method is recommended for securing data in transit between Azure data centers?

- **TLS protocols**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! TLS protocols encrypt data in transit, ensuring secure data exchange.
- Role-based access control
- Symmetric encryption
- Disk encryption

8. Question 8
   What is the purpose of using network security groups (NSGs) in Azure VNets?

- To monitor real-time network traffic patterns
- **To filter inbound and outbound traffic**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! NSGs manage access by filtering network traffic to enhance security.
- To create peering connections between VNets
- To encrypt data between subnets

9. Question 9
   Which benefit does Azure Key Vault offer organizations that are managing sensitive data?

- Automatic data encryption across all applications
- Automatic backup of all keys to external storage
- **Centralized control over access to encryption keys**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Azure Key Vault allows organizations to manage access to encryption keys securely and centrally.
- Real-time monitoring of all encrypted data

10. Question 10
    What role does just-in-time (JIT) access play in managing VM security risks in Azure?

- It prevents all external users from accessing the VM network
- It provides automatic real-time encryption for VM data
- **It helps control unauthorized access by limiting open ports**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! JIT access improves security by limiting port access, thus reducing the risk of external attacks.
- It blocks incoming network traffic by default
