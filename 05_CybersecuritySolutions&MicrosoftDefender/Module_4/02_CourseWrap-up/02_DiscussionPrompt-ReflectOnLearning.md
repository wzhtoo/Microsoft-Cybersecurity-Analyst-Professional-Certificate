This course helped me understand cybersecurity solutions more deeply. The most valuable thing I learned was how to identify and respond to threats, which I know will be useful in real-world situations.

I especially liked the hands-on exercisesâ€”they helped me remember things better and practice what I learned.

One challenge I faced was understanding some of the complex security tools, but going over the lessons again and reading more helped me.

Now, I see cybersecurity not just as tech work, but as protecting people and organizations. I plan to keep learning about advanced tools and maybe even take more security-focused courses.

Thanks to the instructors and my classmatesâ€”reading your thoughts really helped me grow too!

Some tools were hard, but I read again and got better.
Now I know cybersecurity is not just tech, itâ€™s about helping others too.
