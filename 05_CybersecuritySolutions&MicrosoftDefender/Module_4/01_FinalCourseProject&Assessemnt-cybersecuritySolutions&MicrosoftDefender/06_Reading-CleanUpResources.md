# Clean up resources

## Introduction

It's a good idea at the end of an exercise or project to identify whether you still need the resources that you have created. Resources left running can cost you money.

## Using Microsoft Azure Subscription

If you completed all the steps in an exercise and no longer need the resources, delete these resources so that you don't continue to accrue charges. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources.

**Note:** Take care when deleting resource groups as all resources in the resource group will also be deleted.

## Steps for deleting resources

When you're working in your subscription, you can use the following steps in the Azure portal to delete the resource group and all associated resources.

1.  Select the **Resource groups** link in the left sidebar.
2.  Locate the resource group you created in the list.
3.  Right-click on the resource group entry and select **Delete resource group** from the context menu. You can also click the "..." menu element on the right side of the entry to get to the same context menu.
4.  Type the resource group name into the confirmation field.
5.  Click the **Delete** button. This may take several minutes.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have cleaned up the resources that you no longer need, to avoid any unexpected charges.
