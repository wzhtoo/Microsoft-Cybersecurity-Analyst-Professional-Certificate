### Setting up your free Azure account
## Microsoft Azure account
In this course, you will need an Azure account to enable you to apply what you are learning through hands-on exercises.

To create your Azure account, you must have a Microsoft account.

### Microsoft account
A Microsoft account connects all your Microsoft apps and services, so it will be particularly useful to have one while you are doing the courses in the program. 

You can sign into a Microsoft account without a Microsoft email. It is not a requirement to have an Outlook email address. You can also use an email address from Hotmail, Gmail, Yahoo, or other providers to sign into your Microsoft account.

## Troubleshoot yourâ€¯new accountâ€¯signupâ€¯processâ€¯â€¯
Usually, the Azure account signup is a simple and trouble-free process. But if you needâ€¯more information on signing up for a new account on the Azure portal or Azure accountâ€¯center, please visit this [Microsoft website ðŸ”—](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/troubleshoot-subscription/troubleshoot-azure-sign-up) for troubleshooting.â€¯ 

## How to upgrade your Azure free account
For information about how to upgrade your account please read this article on {upgrading your free account ðŸ”—}(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription). 

When you upgrade your Azure free account, you keep your remaining credits for the full 30 days from when you signed up. For example, if you signed up on November 1 and upgraded on November 5, any unused credits will be available until November 30. You also have access to free services for 12 months after the upgrade. 

## Clean-up
If you are using your own Azure subscription, it is recommended that you follow the Clean Up instructions to stop compute resources after completing each lesson. When you're working on your own subscription, it's also a good idea at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources individually or delete the resource group to delete the entire set of resources. 

**Note:** If you decide not to complete this module, be sure to stop your compute instance to avoid incurring unnecessary charges to yourâ€¯MicrosoftAzure subscription.â€¯ 

The compute targets will take some time to be created. You can move on to the next unit while you wait.â€¯
