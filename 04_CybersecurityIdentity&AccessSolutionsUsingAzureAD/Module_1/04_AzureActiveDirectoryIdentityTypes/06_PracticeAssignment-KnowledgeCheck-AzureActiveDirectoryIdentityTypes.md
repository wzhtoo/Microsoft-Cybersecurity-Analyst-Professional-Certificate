1.  Question 1
    A developer wants an application to connect to Azure resources that support Azure AD authentication without having to manage any credentials. Which option best describes the identity type of this application?

- Service principal
- **Managed Identity**
  - Correct! Managed identities are a type of service principal that is automatically managed in Azure AD, eliminating the need for developers to manage credentials.
- Hybrid identity
- User identity

2. Question 2
   You would like to link your organization with an external one so that you can access each other's resources and collaborate more efficiently. Both parties use Azure AD. Which of the following services would you use to accomplish this?

- B2B collaboration
- B2B direct connect
- Azure AD B2C
- Azure AD multi-tenant organization

3. Question 3
   Which of the following are benefits of applying identity scope to a role in AAD? Select all that apply.

- **Identity scope simplifies management.**
  - Correct! Identity scope means that a given role has a constrained ability to use resources; this can simplify resource provisioning and budget planning
- **Identity scope provides better security.**
  - Correct! Compartmentalizing each roleâ€™s access increases a companyâ€™s security and limits any potential fallout in the event of a phishing attack.
- Identity scope lowers costs.
- Identity scope provides easier resource access.

4. Question 4
   True or False: Identity granted to access a network using AAD can only be assigned to a human user.

- True
- **False**
  - Correct! Identity relates to more than humans and can be extended to any actor using a system.

5. Question 5
   Which of the following is an identity provider?

- **OKTA**
  - Correct! This is a centralized IDP similar to AAD that provides people with identities for online access.
- OIDC
