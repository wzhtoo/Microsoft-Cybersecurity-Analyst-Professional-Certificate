In Azure Active Directory it is possible to create groups and assign special privileges or restrictions to them. This improves the over security of an organization.

In the previous exercise, you were tasked with drawing a comparison of contrasting self-service password reset (SSPR) access. Answer the following questions to make sure that you understood and executed the tasks correctly.

1.  Question 1
    Which of the following statements is true regarding the implementation of SSPR?

- **The "SSPR_Enabled" group can reset their passwords without administrator intervention.**
  - Correct! The "SSPR_Enabled" group has the privilege to reset their passwords without administrative intervention.
- The "SSPR_not_Enabled" group can reset their passwords without administrative intervention.
- Both the "SSPR_Enabled" and "SSPR_not_Enabled" groups can reset their passwords without administrator intervention.

2. Question 2
   What is the purpose of "Step 4: Register a user in the SSPR implementation process"?

- To configure SSPR functionality for the user.
- To demonstrate the user's ability to access the password reset.
- To confirm that the user cannot access SSPR.
- **To create a user account on the application website**
  - Correct! Step 4 involves registering a user on the application website.

3. Question 3
   How many groups did you create in completing the assignment?

- One
- **Two**
  - Correct! It is important to create two groups, one with the SSPR enabled and one without, in order to compare the difference.
- No groups were created
