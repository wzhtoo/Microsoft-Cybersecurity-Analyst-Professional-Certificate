In Azure AD, the ability to identify yourself and configure permissions based on this identity is achievable. In this exercise, you have examined the steps to configure an application called the SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) Toolkit so that it accepts the identity and authorization furnished by Azure.

Answer the following questions to make sure that you understood and executed the tasks correctly.

1.  Question 1
    What is the purpose of configuring the Azure AD SAML Toolkit from the enterprise applications on your Azure AD?

- To establish strong security parameters for the Azure AD SAML Toolkit.
- **To allow employees to use company applications without repeatedly signing on.**
  - Correct! Configuring the Azure AD SAML Toolkit enables single sign-on (SSO), allowing users to access applications without having to re-enter their credentials.
- To extract the Raw certificate, Identifier ID, Reply URL, and Sign-On URL.

2. Question 2
   Why is it essential to register with the SAML Toolkit Application?

- To configure SSO for Azure AD.
- To create credentials for the SAML Toolkit application.
- **To extract the Azure AD Identifier and the SP Initiated login URL.**
  - Correct! Registering with the SAML Toolkit Application allows users to extract the necessary SAML login details, including the Azure AD Identifier and the SP Initiated login URL, required for configuring SSO.

3. Question 3
   What is the final step to achieve single sign-on (SSO) after registering with the SAML Toolkit Application?

- Test your implementation.
- **Configure the SAML on the application with Azure AD information.**
  - Correct! After registering with the SAML Toolkit Application, the final step is to configure the SAML settings on the application using the information provided by Azure AD to achieve single sign-on.
- Create the SAML Toolkit in the Azure AD enterprise applications.
