1.  Question 1
    True or False: Samâ€™s Scoops can use Azure Identity Protection tools, such as risk evaluation, sign-in risk analysis, and threat intelligence to detect and respond to threats, covering all locations.

- True
- **False**

2. Question 2
   Samâ€™s Scoops uses security features such as Azure AD Conditional Access and multi-factor authentications to better secure access to sensitive resources. However, Sam has heard that the practice of "treating identity as the primary security perimeter" would provide attention protection. Which of the following is a benefit of this approach?

- Treating identity as the primary security perimeter increases the attack surface for organizations.
- Treating identity as the primary security perimeter decreases visibility and control over user accounts and activities.
- **Treating identity as the primary security perimeter improves compliance with industry regulations.**
  - Correct! Treating identity as the primary security perimeter improves compliance with industry regulations such as HIPAA and PCI DSS.
- Treating identity as the primary security perimeter guarantees the safety of your organizationâ€™s resources and data.

3. Question 3
   Which of the following are recommended strategies for treating identity as the primary security perimeter? Select all that apply.

- **Enable single sign-on.**
  - Correct! Enabling single sign-on is one of the recommended strategies where access to devices, apps, and services is possible from anywhere, and at any time. This simplifies gaining access and the need for users to remember multiple sets of credentials.
- **Turn on Conditional Access.**
  - Correct! Azure AD Conditional Access is one of the recommended strategies and allows you to make access control decisions based on conditions for accessing your cloud apps. A best practice is configuring common policies to manage and control access.
- Enable a single authentication method that is applied consistently.
- Use legacy authentication protocols.

- Azure AD Secure Score
- Compliance Assessment
- **Identity Secure Score**
  - Correct! Azure AD provides a numerical score to measure your security posture objectively through the Identity Secure Score feature.

5. Question 5
   True or False: Microsoft offers features to protect access to applications represented by workload identities and to protect access to resources from workload identities.

- **True**
  - Correct! Microsoft offers features to protect access to applications represented by workload identities and to protect access to resources from workload identities.
- False
