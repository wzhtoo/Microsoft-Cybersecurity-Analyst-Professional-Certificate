1.  Question 1
    You have created a new Conditional Access policy and would like to define the signals that are considered when making policy decisions. Which signals can you configure for this? Select all that apply.

- **User or group membership**
  - Correct! User or group membership is indeed a signal that Conditional Access can consider when making policy decisions. It allows administrators to target policies to specific users, groups, directory roles, or even external guest users.
- **Device information**
  - Correct! Device information is a signal that Conditional Access can consider when making policy decisions. It can be used to enforce policies based on specific platforms or device state
- **Application-specific triggers**
  - Correct! Application-specific triggers are a signal that Conditional Access can consider when making policy decisions. Policies can be triggered based on specific applications that users attempt to access.
- Network infrastructure

2. Question 2
   What is the purpose of Conditional Access templates in Microsoft Entra ID?

- **Conditional Access templates provide preconfigured policies aligned with Microsoft's recommendations.**
  - Correct! Conditional Access templates offer preconfigured policies that align with Microsoft's recommendations, providing maximum protection and following commonly used policies across different customer types and locations.
- Conditional Access templates enable real-time sign-in risk detection.
- Conditional Access templates allow users to be productive wherever and whenever.
- Conditional Access templates protect the organization's assets.

3. Question 3
   Which scenarios are categories in which Conditional Access policy templates are filtered? Select all that apply.

- **Secure foundation**
  - Correct! Secure foundation is one of the categories in which Conditional Access policy templates are filtered.
- **Zero Trust**
  - Correct! Zero Trust is one of the categories in which Conditional Access policy templates are filtered.
- **Remote work**
  - Correct! Remote work is one of the categories in which Conditional Access policy templates are filtered.
- Data classification

4. Question 4
   True or False: The "Report Only" option for enabling Conditional Access policies gathers insights and assesses the potential impact of the policy without enforcing it.

- **True**
  - Correct! With the "Report Only" option, you can gather insights and assess the potential impact of the policy without enforcing it. This mode allows you to generate detailed reports and logs to understand how the policy would have affected access if it were in the "On" state.
- False

5. Question 5
   What is the purpose of the Off option for enabling Conditional Access policies?

- The Off option enforces the access control rules defined within the policy.
- **The Off option temporarily suspends a policy without deleting it.**
  - Correct! The Off option allows you to temporarily suspend a policy without deleting it. This can be useful for troubleshooting purposes or during maintenance activities when you want to temporarily disable the policy's conditions and access control measures.
- The Off option applies the policy to specific users or groups.

6. Question 6
   What is the purpose of user risk evaluation in Conditional Access?

User risk evaluation determines the probability of a compromised identity or account.

- **User risk evaluation enforces policies based on specific applications.**
  - Correct! User risk evaluation in Conditional Access helps determine the probability of a compromised identity or account. It allows organizations to assess the risk associated with a user's access attempts and take the appropriate actions to enhance security.
- User risk evaluation creates policies based on IP address ranges.
- User risk evaluation enables real-time sign-in risk detection.
