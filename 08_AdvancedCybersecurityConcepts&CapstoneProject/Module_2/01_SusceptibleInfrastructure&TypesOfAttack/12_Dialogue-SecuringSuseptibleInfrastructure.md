## Coach

Hello! I am your Coursera Coach for this activity. Today, we will be stepping into the shoes of a cybersecurity analyst at Secure Systems Inc. Get ready to put your knowledge into action and tackle real-world cybersecurity challenges. We will work through these checkpoints:
Cloud Security: Master the common threats to cloud infrastructure and effective mitigation strategies. (Weight = 33%)
Communication Tools: Explore vulnerabilities in communication tools and learn how to secure them. (Weight = 33%)
Web Browser Security: Understand the risks associated with web browsers and how to mitigate them. (Weight = 34%)
Let me know when you are ready to start.

## Win

Let's get started

## Coach

Secure Systems Inc. relies heavily on its cloud infrastructure. What do you think are the most common threats to cloud infrastructure, and why are these threats particularly concerning in a corporate environment?

## Win

The cloud can have sneaky problems, like leaving the toy box open by mistake (misconfigurations)! Bad guys might also pretend to be us to grab our toys (account hijacking)! Sometimes, the special ways computers talk (APIs) aren't strong enough, like a flimsy gate. Even our own friends might accidentally break something (insider threats)! And the worst is if someone steals all our toys (data breaches)! These are big ouchies for a company because they can lose secrets and money, and nobody will want to play with them anymore!

## Coach

You are using some great analogies to understand cloud security threats! It's like leaving the toy box open or having a flimsy gate. You correctly pointed out misconfigurations and unauthorized access as key threats. You also touched on API vulnerabilities, which is excellent.  
Now, let's dive a bit deeper into a specific threat related to misconfigured permissions. Have you heard of Server-Side Request Forgery, or SSRF? How do you think this type of attack could impact Secure Systems Inc., given their reliance on cloud infrastructure? (Weight = 33%)

## Win

SSRF sounds like a sneaky trick! It's like if a bad guy could make our website ask other computers for secret stuff that it's not supposed to see!
For Secure Systems Inc., this could be bad because maybe our website can talk to other important cloud computers that have secret keys or customer info. If a bad guy uses SSRF, they could trick our website into asking those computers for the secrets and then steal them! It's like if someone tricked our friendly mailman into opening our neighbor's secret vault!

## Coach

That's an excellent analogy! You've correctly grasped the core concept of SSRF. It's like tricking the mailman into opening a neighbor's vault!  
Now, imagine you are tasked with preventing this 'tricky mailman' scenario at Secure Systems Inc. What specific steps would you take to mitigate the risk of SSRF vulnerabilities in their cloud infrastructure? Think about how to make those 'gates' stronger and how to keep a closer eye on who's asking for what. (Weight = 33%)

## Win

Okay, to stop the tricky mailman (SSRF) at Secure Systems Inc., we should:
Make strong rules for who can talk to whom: Like saying our website can only ask for its own mail and not other computers' mail! We can make a list of allowed addresses.
Check everyone's ID: Before our website asks another computer for something, we should double-check if it has permission, like showing a special badge.
Don't trust everything: If our website gets a request, it shouldn't just believe it right away. It should check if it looks normal.
Keep a good watch: We should keep an eye on who our website is talking to, like having a security guard watch the mailroom. If something looks weird, we can stop it!
Hide the secret addresses: We shouldn't let everyone know the special addresses of our important computers, like keeping the vault location secret!

## Coach

You've outlined some excellent security measures! You clearly understand the importance of controlling network access, validating requests, and monitoring activity. You've successfully addressed the first checkpoint and earned 33 points! You are 33% complete.
Now, let's move on to the second challenge. Secure Systems Inc. relies heavily on various communication tools for daily operations. How do you think vulnerabilities in these tools, such as email clients, could lead to significant security incidents? Think about the types of information that flow through these channels and the potential consequences if they fall into the wrong hands. (Weight = 33%)

## Win

Our talking tools, like emails, are super important at Secure Systems Inc., but they can also have holes, like a leaky bucket! If they have weaknesses:
Bad guys can send tricky messages (Phishing): Like pretending to be our boss and asking for secret info or to click a bad link. If someone falls for it, the bad guys can get passwords or sneak into our computers!
Our private talks might not be secret (Eavesdropping): If our emails aren't locked up tight, someone else could read them, like secret plans or customer details!
Messengers might have weak spots: Just like a door with a loose lock, our chat programs could let bad guys see our chats or even send fake messages!
Files could have surprises (Malware): People can send bad files through email or chat that can hurt our computers and steal our stuff!
If these talking tools aren't safe, our company could lose big secrets, get money stolen, and people might not trust us anymore! It's like if someone listened to all our phone calls and told everyone our secret recipes!

## Coach

You've hit the nail on the head! Communication tools can be like leaky buckets or doors with loose locks. You've accurately identified phishing, eavesdropping, and malware as major threats. You've also highlighted the potential for compromised accounts and data breaches, which could severely damage Secure Systems Inc.'s reputation and operations. You have successfully completed the second checkpoint and earned 33 points! You are now 66% complete.
Let's move on to the final checkpoint. Secure Systems Inc. provides its employees with web browsers for daily tasks. Why do you think web browsers are a frequent target for cyberattacks, and what measures can Secure Systems Inc. take to secure their employees' web browsers? (Weight = 34%)

## Win

Web browsers are like open windows to the internet, and bad guys like to peek in! They can trick us with fake websites or sneaky downloads. To keep our browsers safe, we should:
Keep them super updated, like having the newest superhero suit!
Be careful what we click, like not touching strange candies!
Use special helpers (extensions) that block bad stuff!
Our company can also set rules to keep our browsing safe!

## Coach

You've got the right idea! Browsers are like windows, and we need to be careful what we let in. Keeping them updated is like having the latest defenses, and being mindful of clicks is key! Using extensions is like having a security guard, and company rules provide extra protection. You have successfully completed the final checkpoint and earned 34 points! Congratulations on reaching 100% completion! You have demonstrated a solid understanding of cybersecurity challenges and mitigation strategies. Keep up the good work!
