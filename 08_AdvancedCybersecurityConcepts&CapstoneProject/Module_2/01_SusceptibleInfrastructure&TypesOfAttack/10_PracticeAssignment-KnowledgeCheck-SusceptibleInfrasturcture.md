1.  Question 1
    Hannah, a cybersecurity consultant, is reviewing the digital infrastructure of a large multinational corporation. She finds an internal application that inadvertently allows users to request internal resources of the system. Which of the following vulnerabilities is the application exhibiting?

- **Server-side request forgery (SSRF)**
  - That's correct! SSRF vulnerabilities arise when an attacker can make requests to internal resources of a system, potentially leading to unauthorized access to data or further attacks on internal systems.
- Zero-day vulnerabilities
- Type confusion vulnerability
- Typosquatting

2. Question 2
   Anna works as a cybersecurity analyst for a growing startup. Recently, they transitioned their data and applications to a cloud infrastructure for better scalability and flexibility. She wants to ensure they address the key vulnerabilities relevant to their new cloud setup. Which of the following should be Anna's primary focus to secure the cloud infrastructure?

- Regularly updating web browsers and configuring them securely
- Verifying package sources in their software repository and maintaining an updated list of trusted packages
- **Ensuring that there are no configuration issues, addressing shared resources problems, and safeguarding against insecure APIs**
  - That's correct! Cloud infrastructure vulnerabilities often stem from these issues. Ensuring these areas are secure can help mitigate potential threats.

3. Question 3
   A software development company utilizes cloud infrastructure to host applications on public cloud platforms and third-party package repositories for their projects. Which of the following descriptions best represents a thorough understanding of the typosquatting vulnerability and its potential impact on the company's infrastructure?

- Typosquatting is just a phishing method. It won't affect the company since employees are trained not to click on suspicious links.
- **Typosquatting can pose a risk, especially for package repositories. Attackers might register domains similar to popular packages, tricking developers into using malicious versions.**
  - That's correct! The company should regularly verify package sources and employ automated security scans. Additionally, pre-registering common misspellings of our domain names can prevent domain mimicking.
- Typosquatting only affects web browsers. The company should warn users to be cautious when entering URLs.

4. Question 4
   True or False: The MITRE ATT&CK Matrix focuses only on the actions of cyber attackers after they have breached a system, thereby offering insights for post-incident scenarios.

- True
- **False**
  - That's correct! The MITRE ATT&CK Matrix also focuses on pre-attack phases, giving insight into what adversaries might do before breaching a system.

5. Question 5
   Jane, a cybersecurity officer, received an email from an external consultant she's been working with. The email contains an attachment and a message urging her to review the contents immediately for the upcoming presentation. However, Jane didn't expect any files from the consultant that day. What should Jane's first course of action be?

- Jane should download and scan the attachment with an antivirus tool.
- **Jane should contact the consultant directly through official channels, like a known phone number, to verify the email's legitimacy before opening the attachment.**
  - That's correct! Given the sudden nature of the email and its urgency, verifying its legitimacy before acting is crucial in preventing potential phishing attacks or malware threats.
- Jane can immediately open the attachment since she recognizes the consultant's email address.
