1.  Question 1
    Mia has to give a presentation on how IoT integration has benefitted the production process at the manufacturing facility she works at. Which of the following points should she emphasize as a key benefit that aligns with the primary function of the IoT devices?

- **The IoT devices have streamlined operational processes, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.**
  - That's correct! IoT devices in manufacturing often increase efficiency by predicting equipment failures before they happen, which can reduce downtime and maintenance costs.
- With IoT devices, the company has enhanced the entertainment system in the employee break rooms.
- IoT devices have enabled the company to track employee attendance and work hours more effectively.

2. Question 2
   A smart home technology auditor discovers several customers' home systems were compromised. The attackers gained access by exploiting unsecured communication channels to intercept data transmissions and control smart home devices. Which type of IoT attack does this scenario describe, and what is the most effective method for preventing such an attack in the future?

- **Unsafe communication attacks â€“ Use strong encryption for data transmission between IoT devices.**
- Firmware hijacking â€“Regularly update and verify the source of IoT device firmware.
- Physical attacks â€“ Implement better physical security measures in customer homes.

3. Question 3
   Elena, a cybersecurity manager at a manufacturing company that uses IoT devices to monitor assembly lines, discovers several IoT devices were part of a botnet involved in a DDoS attack. While the devices' firmware was regularly updated, there were no measures to secure the data in transit or at rest. To prevent future incidents, which security measure should Elena prioritize?

- **Secure connectivity â€“ Ensure secure connectivity to prevent attackers from intercepting data during transmission.**
  - That's correct! Since the incident involved IoT devices that were part of a botnet, ensuring secure connectivity would prevent attackers from intercepting data and commandeering IoT devices for malicious activities.
- Secure provisioning of devices â€“ Securely provision devices from the start.
- Implement zero trust practices â€“ Apply network segmentation to prevent lateral movement.

4. Question 4
   True or False: In a zero-trust security model for IoT, applying network micro-segmentation alone is sufficient to ensure that compromised devices cannot access high-value assets within the network.

- True
- **False**
  - That's correct! While network micro-segmentation is a crucial part of a zero-trust model, it is not sufficient on its own. A comprehensive zero-trust approach requires multiple security layers, including, but not limited to, strong authentication, least-privileged access, device health checks, and regular security updates.

5. Question 5
   An energy company recently started using Microsoft Defender for IoT. Its security team is alerted to suspicious network traffic patterns originating from IoT devices in the operational technology environment. These devices are trying to communicate with external IP addresses known for hosting malware command and control (C&C) servers. Which of the following steps should the security team take?

- **Verify the alert and investigate the flagged IoT devices using Defender for IoT's device map and security monitoring features.**
  - That's correct! Investigating alerts using Defender for IoT tools is essential to make informed decisions about the threat and understand the context and potential impact on the network.
- Disconnect the IoT devices from the network immediately to prevent potential data exfiltration or further compromise.
- Ignore the alerts as false positives since Defender for IoT might not yet be fully tuned to the company's network profile.
