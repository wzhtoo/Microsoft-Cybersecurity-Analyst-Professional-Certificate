The
IoT device analysis
exercise centered on creating an Internet of Things (IoT) device. You have delved into the multifaceted world of IoT architecture, exploring various aspects, from component selection to security and compliance. Now, as you review your progress, these questions will help you reflect on your learning and insights, assessing your understanding and ability to critically evaluate the practical and security aspects of IoT devices.

1.  Question 1
    A team is working on an IoT device and must ensure secure data transmission to the cloud. Which approach is most effective for protecting data during transmission?

- Restrict data transmission to off-peak hours.

- Utilize public Wi-Fi networks.

- **Implement end-to-end encryption for all data transmissions.**
  - That's correct. End-to-end encryption secures data from the point of origin to the destination, preventing unauthorized access during transmission.

2. Question 2
   Which measures should be prioritized to safeguard user data stored in the cloud? Select all that apply.

- Regular software updates for the device
- **Use of advanced encryption techniques**
  - That's correct! Encryption is a fundamental security measure for protecting data in transit and at rest in the cloud.
- **Adoption of just-in-time (JIT) access**
  - That's correct! JIT access minimizes the attack surface by limiting resource access, which is a key aspect of securing cloud-stored data.
- **Implementation of secure cloud storage solutions**
  - That's correct! Secure cloud storage solutions are essential for protecting stored data from unauthorized access.

1 point 3.
Question 3
Compliance with global regulations is essential when developing an IoT device for international markets. Which regulation or regulatory body is important for the European market?

- Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**
  - That's correct! GDPR compliance ensures user data privacy and security in the European market.
