Hello everyone!

I'm Win Zaw Htoo, and I'm from Myanmar. My country is known for its rich culture, beautiful landscapes, and warm-hearted people. Despite facing many challenges, Myanmar is full of resilience and hope, which inspires me every day.

I enrolled in this course because Iâ€™m passionate about cybersecurity and eager to build a career in this field. I've completed several previous courses, and this capstone is a great way to bring everything together. I'm especially excited to learn about advanced security concepts and how to apply them in real-world scenarios.

Through this course, I hope to gain hands-on experience, strengthen my problem-solving skills, and deepen my understanding of how to detect, respond to, and recover from cyber threats. These skills are very important for me as I aim to work in a professional cybersecurity role one day.

I plan to use what I learn to help organizations protect their data and systems, and to contribute to a safer digital world. Whether itâ€™s through a job, volunteering, or helping local businesses, I want to make a positive impact.

Looking forward to learning with all of you! Feel free to reach out. I'd love to hear your stories too.

Best wishes,
Win Zaw Htoo
