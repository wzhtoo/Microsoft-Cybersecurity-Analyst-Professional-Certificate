Welcome to the exercise on threat modeling for a fictional web application named SecureNotes. SecureNotes is a web-based note-taking application that allows users to create, edit, and manage their personal notes. The application aims to provide a secure platform for storing sensitive information. However, every web application is susceptible to security threats that need to be identified and addressed. In this exercise, you learned how to perform a threat model analysis using the STRIDE framework.

1.  Question 1
    Have you thoroughly identified and categorized potential security threats for each component's entry and exit points using the STRIDE framework?

- **Yes**
- No

2. Question 2
   Which type of attack involves manipulating JavaScript code for input?

- Spoofing
- Denial-of-service
- **Tampering**
- Repudiation

3. Question 3
   Which security measure can help mitigate exposure of sensitive data during transmission?

- **Encryption**
- Routine security assessments
- Authentication mechanisms
- Input validation

4. Question 4
   Did you group the identified threats under the appropriate STRIDE categories for each component and entry/exit point?

- **Yes**
- No

5. Question 5
   Did you provide a clear breakdown of threats associated with each component's entry and exit points in your threat model document?

- **Yes**
- No

6. Question 6
   When using the STRIDE framework to analyze threats for the backend server of the web application, which threat category involves manipulating API requests and responses?

- Elevation of privilege
- **Tampering**
- Spoofing
- Repudiation
