1.  Question 1
    What is the purpose of threat modeling in cybersecurity?

- To design network infrastructure for applications
- To debug software applications
- To optimize code for better performance
- **To identify and address security threats to applications**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Threat modeling is the process of identifying and addressing security threats to applications and systems.

2. Question 2
   In the context of threat modeling, what does decomposing the application involve?

- Defining the scope of the threat model
- Ranking threats based on their severity
- Implementing security controls for the application
- **Breaking down the application into its components**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Decomposing the application means breaking it down into its various components to understand how they interact and where potential vulnerabilities might exist.

3. Question 3
   What do security controls in an application focus on?

- Identifying vulnerabilities through code reviews
- Categorizing valuable resources within the organization
- **Safeguarding the application from threats**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Security controls are mechanisms that protect the application from various threats and vulnerabilities.
- Assessing the security posture of external dependencies

4. Question 4
   Which of the following are purposes of analyzing threats using the STRIDE model in cybersecurity? Select all that apply.

- To design physical security around the datacenter
- To assess hardware compatibility
- **To identify potential vulnerabilities**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! One of the purposes of analyzing threats using the STRIDE model is to identify potential vulnerabilities in the system.
- **To categorize and rank threats**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Another purpose of analyzing threats using the STRIDE model is to categorize and rank different types of threats based on their characteristics.

5. Question 5
   The \***\*\_\_\*\*** model assesses five dimensions: Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, and Discoverability, to evaluate potential risks and prioritize mitigation efforts in cybersecurity.

- Threat Analysis
- Mitigation Strategies
- **DREAD**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The DREAD model assesses five dimensions to evaluate potential risks and prioritize mitigation efforts in cybersecurity.
- Quantitative Risk
