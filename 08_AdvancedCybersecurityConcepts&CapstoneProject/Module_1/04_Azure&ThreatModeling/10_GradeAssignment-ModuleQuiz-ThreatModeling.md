1.  Question 1
    Which of the following statements best describes the primary goal of threat modeling in the context of web application security?

- To document potential threats without necessarily taking corrective action
- To identify and fix all vulnerabilities post-production
- **To proactively identify, understand, and address potential threats during the development process.**
  - That's correct! Threat modeling aims to proactively pinpoint, comprehend, and address potential threats throughout the development lifecycle, ensuring security is integrated from the onset.
- To conduct frequent security audits and report findings

2. Question 2
   When decomposing an application for threat modeling, what is the significance of understanding the application's purpose?

- **It assists in recognizing potential motives behind attacks.**
  - That's correct! Understanding the application's purpose is crucial for recognizing potential motives behind attacks
- It defines the application's technical specifications.
- It determines the architecture of the application.
- It helps determine the number of components.

3. Question 3
   What is the primary goal of threat categorization in cybersecurity?

- To predict specific attack methods
- To create a list of potential countermeasures
- To develop a comprehensive threat encyclopedia
- **To develop a clear understanding of the threat landscape**
  - That's correct! The primary goal of threat categorization is to understand the threat landscape clearly. Explanation: This understanding helps organizations prioritize security efforts.

4. Question 4
   What is one of the advantages of threat modeling?

- **Reducing the attack surface of a system or application**
  - That's correct! Threat modeling helps reduce the attack surface by identifying and analyzing potential points of entry for malicious actors.
- Developing a comprehensive threat encyclopedia
- Creating redundancy and failover mechanisms
- Predicting specific attack methods

5. Question 5
   You are working as a cybersecurity analyst at a large financial institution. Your manager has assigned you to explain the PASTA framework to a newly hired junior analyst. What do you tell them is the primary focus of the PASTA framework in cybersecurity?

- Developing cybersecurity policies and procedures
- **Identifying, assessing, and prioritizing potential threats and risks**
  - That's correct! The primary focus of the PASTA framework is to identify, assess, and prioritize potential threats and risks within an organization.
- Identifying specific attackers and their motivations
- Implementing technical security controls

6. Question 6
   In the context of cybersecurity, what three dimensions does the CVSS Version v3.1 Calculator use to assess and prioritize vulnerabilities?

- Threat landscapes, Zero-Day Exploits, and Data Exfiltration
- **Base Metrics, Temporal Metrics, and Environmental Metrics**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! You're on the right track. The CVSS Version v3.1 Calculator assesses and prioritizes vulnerabilities based on these three dimensions.
- Network Architecture, Intrusion Detection, and Malware Analysis
- Attack Vectors, Exploit Code Generation, and Threat Actors

7. Question 7
   True or False: VAST integrates machine learning techniques to automate threat detection and response processes.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! While VAST emphasizes improved threat detection and management, it doesn't specifically state the integration of machine learning techniques.

8. Question 8
   Which of the following are benefits of the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool? Select all that apply.

- **It enables software architects to identify and address potential security issues early in the development process.**
  - That's correct! By offering a proactive approach, the tool allows for early detection and mitigation of security vulnerabilities during the software development lifecycle.
- **It offers automation functionalities that provide feedback during model creation.**
  - That's correct! The tool integrates automation capabilities, assisting users with immediate feedback as they create and adjust their threat models.
- It automatically patches vulnerabilities without user intervention.
- **It provides clear guidance on creating and analyzing threat models.**
  - That's correct! The Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool offers a structured approach to help users understand, design, and analyze threat models efficiently.

9. Question 9
   What is the primary objective of Phase 4 in the SDL process for Azure Virtual Networks?

- To identify potential security threats and vulnerabilities
- To implement security measures
- To create a network diagram
- **To validate the effectiveness of security controls**
  - That's correct! The primary objective of Phase 4 is to validate the effectiveness of the security controls implemented within Azure Virtual Networks. It involves testing and assessing these controls to ensure they work as intended to secure the network environment.

10. Question 10
    Which question of the Four Question Framework of threat modeling emphasizes the iterative process of ensuring that security measures are consistent, effective, and aligned with an organization's security goals?

- What is the team working on?
- **Did the team do a good job?**
  - That's correct! This question underlines the importance of evaluation and continuous improvement, ensuring that threat modeling and security measures remain effective and in line with the organization's objectives.
