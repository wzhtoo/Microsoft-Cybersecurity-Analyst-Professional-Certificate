Overview
In the
Web application threat modeling
exercise, you created a threat model for a web application using the Microsoft Threat Model Tool. Use the following questions to evaluate if you understood and executed the instructions correctly.

1.  Question 1
    Where is the web app hosted?

- **In a perimeter or Internet-facing segregated network**
- In the cloud
- On a local machine
- In a secured data center

2. Question 2
   Which component stores and retrieves data for the web app?

- Authentication method
- **SQL database**
  - That's correct! The SQL database stores and retrieves data for the web app.
- Firewall
- Web server

3. Question 3
   What is one key security consideration for the architecture?

- The number of web server instances
- The speed of the database server
- The resilience of the load balancer configuration
- **Data encryption**
  - Correct
    That's correct! Data encryption is a key security consideration for the architecture.

4. Question 4
   In the context of the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, what is the primary purpose of creating trust boundaries within a threat model?

- To automate the generation of code
- To delineate communication channels between software components
- To specify the number of server instances required
- **To segregate trusted and untrusted components, helping to identify potential attack vectors**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Creating trust boundaries helps segregate trusted and untrusted components, making it easier to identify potential attack vectors and security risks.

5. Question 5
   In the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool, what is the primary purpose of the data flow diagram component?

- To define the number of server instances required
- To specify the color scheme for the threat model
- **To visualize the flow of data within the application and identify potential security vulnerabilities**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The data flow diagram in the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool is used to visualize the flow of data within the application and identify potential security vulnerabilities.
- To automate code reviews
