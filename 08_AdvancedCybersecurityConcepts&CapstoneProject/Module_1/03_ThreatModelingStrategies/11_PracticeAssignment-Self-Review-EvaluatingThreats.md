Introduction
In the exercise
Evaluating threats
, you assessed and rated the severity of a hypothetical security vulnerability in Sam's Scoops firewall. Use the following questions to evaluate if you understood and executed the instructions correctly.

1.  Question 1
    What is the CVSS Base Score for the hypothetical security vulnerability described in the scenario?

    - **10.0**
      - That's correct! The CVSS Base Score for this vulnerability is 10.0, indicating it is critical.
    - 8.5
    - 7.5
    - 5.0

2.  Question 2
    According to the CVSS score, the severity of the vulnerability falls into which category?

- High
- Low
- **Critical**
  - That's correct! The CVSS score falls into the critical category (9.0-10.0), indicating a significant risk.
- Medium

3. Question 3
   What is one of the recommended mitigation steps for this critical vulnerability?

- Apply strong encryption to all data
- Disable the web application firewall
- Perform regular vulnerability scans
- **Implement network segmentation**
  - That's correct! Implementing network segmentation helps isolate the web server from critical systems, reducing the potential scope of compromise.

4. Question 4
   In the CVSS Temporal Score, what does "Report Confidence (RC): Confirmed" mean?

- The vulnerability is not confirmed.
- The vulnerability is highly likely to be exploited.
- **The vulnerability has been confirmed by multiple sources.**
  - That's correct! "Report Confidence (RC): Confirmed" indicates the confidence level in the accuracy of information about the vulnerability. It should be confirmed by multiple sources, adding confidence to its existence.
- The vulnerability has not yet been confirmed, but it has a significant impact.

5. Question 5
   Which metric in the CVSS calculation assesses the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability?

- **Base Score**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The Base Score in the CVSS calculation assesses the impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It provides a fundamental assessment of the vulnerability's severity, independent of the specific environment in which it occurs. It is a key component in determining the overall risk posed by a vulnerability.
- Exploitability Subscore
- Temporal Score
- Environmental Score
