1.  Question 1
    You are a security engineer at a large organization, and you are currently working on a new web application that will be used to store and process customer data.

Which of the following is the best approach to securing this new web application?

- Implement security features at the end of the development process.
- Implement security features only after the application is deployed and in production.
- **Implement security features throughout the development lifecycle.**
  - That's correct! Implementing security features throughout the development lifecycle is the best approach to securing web applications. This allows security vulnerabilities to be identified and fixed early before the application is deployed and in production.
- Implement security features only after a security audit has been performed.

2. Question 2
   True or False: The Equifax data breach could have been prevented by integrating cyber threat modeling practices into the development lifecycle.

- **True**
  - That's correct! By integrating cyber threat modeling into the development lifecycle, Equifax could have identified and eliminated the unpatched vulnerability in the Apache Struts web application framework before the breach occurred.
- False

3. Question 3
   The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score is a valuable tool for security teams to **\*\***\_\_**\*\***.

- Decide which vulnerabilities to ignore.
- **Determine patching efforts.**
  - That's correct! The CVSS score helps security teams prioritize their patching efforts by indicating the severity of vulnerabilities, allowing them to focus on addressing the most critical ones first.
- Determine the cost of security breaches.

4. Question 4
   Which step of the PASTA framework involves identifying potential threats and attackers based on real-world scenarios?

- Step 1: Initial assessment
- **Step 2: Threat modeling**
  - That's correct! Step 2 of the PASTA framework involves identifying potential threats and attackers based on real-world scenarios. This step encourages creative thinking and gives a holistic view of potential vulnerabilities.
- Step 3: Vulnerability analysis
- Step 4: Control analysis

5. Question 5
   What is the primary purpose of the business impact analysis step in the PASTA framework?

- **Quantifying the potential consequences of successful attacks**
  - That's correct! The business impact analysis step in the PASTA framework aims to quantify the potential consequences of successful attacks.
- Evaluating existing security controls
- Assessing the effectiveness of vulnerability analysis
- Identifying potential attackers
