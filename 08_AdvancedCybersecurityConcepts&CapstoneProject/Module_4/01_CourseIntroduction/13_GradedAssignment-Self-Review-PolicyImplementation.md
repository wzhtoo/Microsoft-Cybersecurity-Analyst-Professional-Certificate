In Stage 5 of your project for VIP Events, you've taken on the critical task of developing and specifying Azure Policy configurations, with a focus on user authentication and network configuration for web applications. Your work involved crafting recommendations to secure Azure resources effectively and designing network guidelines tailored for web applications. These self-review questions will help you reflect on your approach.

1.  Question 1
    What is the most effective way to enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for users in the user authentication policy? Select all that apply.

Implement MFA for all users and allow them to opt out if necessary.

## Enable MFA for critical user accounts and provide alternative authentication methods for other users.

## Enforce MFA for specific user roles based on their access privileges.

Require MFA for all users regardless of their role.

Question 2
What are the best ways to restrict access to specific virtual networks (VNETs) when setting up a network configuration policy for web applications? Select all that apply.

## Block all traffic from the internet and allow connections only from authorized VNETs.

## Utilize role-based access control (RBAC) to specify which users or groups can access the web applications from different VNETs.

Implement a MAC address filtering system, allowing access only to devices with specific hardware addresses.

Employ a geolocation-based access policy, permitting connections only from specified locations.

## Implement a whitelist approach, explicitly allowing access from predefined VNETs.

Question 3
When designing and implementing security policies for VIP Events, which of the following approaches is the most effective in mitigating insider threats? Select all that apply.

## Establish clear reporting procedures for suspicious activity and empower employees to raise concerns without fear of retaliation.

## Conduct regular security awareness training for all employees, including event staff.

Deploy perimeter defenses such as firewalls and intrusion prevention systems at the Internet-facing network to block threats from infiltrating the network.

## Implement least privilege principles, granting users only the access they need to perform their tasks.

## Implement continuous monitoring of user activity and utilize anomaly detection algorithms to identify potential insider threats.

Implement a honeypot system within the network, intentionally exposing false vulnerabilities to divert insider threats.
