[Assignment ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-cybersecurity-concepts-and-capstone-project/assignment-submission/31urw/self-review-company-requirements/attempt)

In Stage 1 you've tackled tasks ranging from assessing cybersecurity needs to setting up physical security guidelines. This foundational stage of your cybersecurity proposal involves defining the project's scope and identifying specific deliverables. These self-review questions are designed to help you evaluate your understanding and application of security principles in addressing VIP Events' network needs, ensuring a solid foundation for the upcoming stages of your project.

1.  Question 1
    In Task 5 of Stage 1, you had to define user roles. What is the primary purpose of doing this?

- Creating a comprehensive layered security approach
- **Enhancing security and access control**
  - That's correct! Enhancing security and access control aligns with the primary objective outlined in the Capstone check-in
- Identifying security vulnerabilities
- Designing network subnets

2. Question 2
   Which of the following is the most important consideration when designing a network subnet? Select all that apply.

- **The size of the subnet**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The size of the subnet is an important consideration because it directly affects network performance and scalability
- **The type of traffic on the subnet**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Considering the type of traffic is essential because different types of network traffic (like video, voice, and data) have different requirements.
- The physical location of the devices
- **The number of devices on the subnet**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The number of devices on the subnet is an important consideration because it determines how the subnet needs to be structured to efficiently handle traffic and manage resources.

3. Question 3
   What is the primary focus of securing Layer 0 in the defense in depth approach?

- **Implementing measures to control physical access and security**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Securing Layer 0 in the defense in depth approach involves implementing measures to control physical access and security, such as ID-based access control on doors and main entrances. This layer addresses the foundational physical security aspects of the overall defense strategy.
- Assessing cybersecurity requirements for VIP Events
- Implementing firewalls at the network perimeter
- Configuring a secure identity provider Azure AD tenant and creating user accounts
