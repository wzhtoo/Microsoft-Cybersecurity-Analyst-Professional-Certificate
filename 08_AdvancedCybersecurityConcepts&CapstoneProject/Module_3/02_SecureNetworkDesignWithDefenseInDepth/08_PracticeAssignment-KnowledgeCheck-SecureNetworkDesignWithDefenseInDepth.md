1.  Question 1
    Which principle is the cornerstone of safeguarding sensitive data in the defense in depth strategy?

- **Confidentiality**
  - That's correct! Confidentiality is the cornerstone of safeguarding sensitive data in the defense in depth strategy, ensuring that data can only be accessed by those explicitly granted permission.
- Availability
- Integrity

2. Question 2
   Which components are critical in controlling inbound and outbound traffic and ensuring only authorized access in a layered security approach? Select all that apply.

- Intrusion detection systems (IDS)
- **Security groups**
  - That's correct! Security groups are important for controlling traffic and access.
- **Firewalls**
  - That's correct! Firewalls are essential for controlling traffic and access.
- Azure Virtual WAN

3. Question 3
   Which layer of the defense in depth approach guards against network-based attacks?

- Layer 2 - Identity and access
- Layer 3 - Perimeter
- **Layer 4 - Network**
  - **Explanation:**
    Layer 4 - Network in the defense in depth approach is focused on restricting and controlling network connectivity to prevent unauthorized access and mitigate network-based attacks. It typically involves measures like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation to secure the network and control communication between assets.

**Other layers:**
Layer 2 - Identity and Access: This layer is more about managing user identities and controlling who has access to which resources, using methods like authentication and authorization.

Layer 3 - Perimeter: This layer focuses on securing the perimeter of the network and protecting the organization's boundaries through methods such as perimeter firewalls and intrusion prevention systems. It's closely related but not the same as Layer 4.

Layer 1 - Physical Security: This layer is concerned with securing the physical infrastructure, such as securing access to data centers and ensuring the physical safety of devices and hardware.

Thus, Layer 4 - Network is specifically designed to guard against network-based attacks.

- Layer 1 - Physical security

4. Question 4
   Your organization is considering implementing Microsoft Defender for Cloud for threat detection. Which Microsoft Defender for Cloud feature can help you identify potential threats and vulnerabilities? Select all that apply.

- **Adaptive application controls**
  - That's correct! Microsoft Defender for Cloud provides features like adaptive application controls, which use machine learning to monitor and block malicious applications.
- Virtual machine optimization
- **Real-time network monitoring**
  - That's correct. Real-time network monitoring is valuable for identifying threats and vulnerabilities.
- Continuous data backup

5. Question 5
   In the context of Azure Secure Virtual Networks, what is the primary purpose of segmenting your network into subnets and enforcing network security policies?

- To increase network complexity for enhanced security
- To optimize data transfer speeds within the network
- **To improve security by isolating network resources and controlling network access**
  - That's correct! The primary purpose of segmenting your network into subnets and enforcing network security policies is to improve security by isolating network resources and controlling network access.
