1.  Question 1
    What are the benefits of incremental backup? Select all that apply.

- Eliminates the need for full backups.
- Decreases the time required for data recovery.
- **Faster backup process.**
  - That's correct. Incremental backups typically require less time to complete than full backups because they only save the changes made since the last backup, reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.
- **Saves storage space compared to full backups.**
  - That's correct. Incremental backups only save the changes made since the last backup, resulting in smaller backup sizes and reduced storage space requirements compared to full backups.

2. Question 2 \***\*\_\*\*** is a full disc encryption software that comes with recent Windows operating systems.

- Veracrypt
- FileVault
- **Bitlocker**
  - That's correct. Bitlocker is a full disk encryption software that is included with recent Windows operating systems, such as Windows 10 and Windows 11. It provides encryption for entire disk drives, protecting the data stored on them in case of theft or unauthorized access.
- GPG

3. Question 3
   Which of the following protections are offered by modern antimalware programs? Select all that apply.

- Spam protection
- **Web protection**
  - That's correct. Modern antimalware programs often offer web protection as a feature. Web protection helps to safeguard users while browsing the internet by blocking access to malicious websites, detecting, and blocking malicious downloads, and providing real-time scanning and protection against online threats such as phishing attempts and drive-by downloads.
- Recover encrypted files from ransomware
- **File protection**
  - That's correct. Modern antimalware programs often offer file protection as a key feature. File protection involves real-time scanning and monitoring of files on a system, including incoming and outgoing files, to detect and block any malware or malicious activities associated with the files. This helps to prevent the execution or opening of infected files and protects the integrity of the user's files and data.

4. Question 4
   **\_\_** is a type of phishing attack where the victim is tricked using voice calls

- Smishing
- Pretexting
- **Vishing**
  - That's correct. Vishing, also known as voice phishing, is a type of phishing attack where the victim is tricked using voice calls. In vishing attacks, the attacker typically poses as a legitimate entity or organization, such as a bank or a service provider, and makes phone calls to the victim. Through social engineering techniques, the attacker aims to deceive the victim into revealing sensitive information.
- Social engineering

5.  Question 5
    Consider a scenario where cybercriminals have found that employees in an organization frequently visit a particular website for their daily work. To install the malware in the computers of that organization, cybercriminals infect the website with the expectation that some employees will fall for this trap, allowing the cyber criminals to install malware on their computers. What type of attack is this?

- Quid Pro Quo
- **Watering hole attack**
  - That's correct. The scenario described here is a watering hole attack where cybercriminals identify a website that is frequently visited by the targeted individuals or organizations. The attackers compromise the website by injecting malicious code or malware into it. When the employees visit the compromised website, their computers may become infected with malware, allowing the attackers to gain unauthorized access to the targeted organization's systems or steal sensitive information.
- Pretexting
- Whaling

6. Question 6
   What is the role of a command-and-control center in a malware lifecycle?

- **Coordinate and control the infected systems**
  - That's correct! The command-and-control center serves as the central hub for the malware operation. It is responsible for coordinating and controlling the infected systems, issuing commands to the compromised devices, and receiving data or instructions from the malware.
- Encrypt and decrypt sensitive information
- Monitor network traffic for suspicious activities
- Remove malware from infected systems

7. Question 7
   \_**\_ affected nearly all the intel processors. \_\_\_** also affected AMD and ARM chips. Select all that apply.

- Spectre, Meltdown
- **Meltdown, Spectre**
  - That's correct. Spectre is a vulnerability that affected nearly all Intel processors, along with AMD and ARM chips. Meltdown, on the other hand, primarily impacted Intel processors. Both vulnerabilities were discovered in early 2018 and allowed attackers to potentially access sensitive information through speculative execution side-channel attacks.
- Meltdown, Meltdown
- Spectre, Spectre

8. Question 8
   Which of the following malware is specially designed to hide successfully in an infected computer?

- Exploit kit
- **Rootkits**
  - That's correct. Rootkits are a type of malware that is specifically designed to hide successfully in an infected computer. They employ various techniques to conceal their presence and activities, such as modifying system components, intercepting system calls, or using stealth mechanisms. Rootkits are notoriously difficult to detect and remove, making them a powerful tool for attackers to maintain unauthorized access and control over compromised systems.
- Trojans
- Worms

9.  Question 9
    True or False: Worms are usually spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems and software applications to gain access to computer systems.

- **True**
  - That's correct. Worms are a type of malware that is typically spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems and software applications to gain access to computer systems. Once a vulnerability is exploited, the worm can self-replicate and spread to other vulnerable systems without requiring any user interaction. By taking advantage of vulnerabilities, worms can rapidly propagate through networks and infect a large number of computers.
- False

10. Question 10
    A **\_\_\_** can self-replicate and spread, while a **\_\_** cannot. Select all that apply.

- Trojan, Virus
- Virus, Worm
- Virus, Trojan
- **Worm, Trojan**
  - That's correct. Worms can self-replicate and spread autonomously through networks or communication channels. Trojans do not possess self-replication capabilities and rely on user interaction to be executed.

   A(n) **\_** is used to distribute other vulnerabilities in an infected system.

- Rootkit
- Botnet
- Trojan
- **Exploit kit**
  - That's correct. Exploit kits are used to distribute and execute various exploits targeting vulnerabilities in an infected system. Exploit kits are often comprised of pre-packaged exploits for different software vulnerabilities. When a victim visits a compromised website or opens a malicious email attachment, the exploit kit leverages these vulnerabilities to deliver and install other forms of malware, such as Trojans, ransomware, or botnet agents.

9. Question 9
