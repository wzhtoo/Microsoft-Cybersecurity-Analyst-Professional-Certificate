1.  Question 1
    What are the benefits of multi-factor authentication? Select all that apply.

- **Even if the password is leaked, it prevents someone from getting access to the user account.**
  - That's correct. Multi-factor authentication requires additional verification, making it difficult for attackers to access an account, even if they have obtained the password.
- **It adds another layer of security on top of the password.**
  - That's correct. Multi-factor authentication requires additional verification methods, such as a code from an authenticator app or a fingerprint, making it harder for unauthorized users to access an account even if they have the password.
- It helps to create better passwords.
- It makes it impossible to hack user accounts.

2. Question 2
   Which of the following is true about biometric security?

- They cannot be used in conjunction with other security measures.
- They can be easily bypassed by guessing a password.
- They require a physical object for authentication.
- **They are vulnerable to false acceptances and rejections.**
  - That's correct. Biometric security systems, while generally accurate, can occasionally produce false acceptances (granting access to an unauthorized individual) or false rejections (denying access to an authorized individual).

3. Question 3
   Suppose your computer is infected with ransomware, leading to the encryption of all your files. Unwilling to pay the ransom, you must find a way to retrieve your data. Which strategies are effective in accomplishing this task?

- Use system restore to revert your computer to an earlier state.
- Click on the ransomware popup to negotiate.
- Download a new antivirus software and scan your system.
- **Restore files from a recent backup.**
  - That's correct. Regular backups of your data can be a lifesaver in case of a ransomware attack. You can restore your system from these backups after removing the ransomware from your system.

4. Question 4
   What are the benefits of using password manager software? Select all that apply.

- **Reduce the need to remember multiple passwords.**
  - That's correct. Password managers can remember and autofill your login credentials, allowing you to access your accounts without having to remember each password.
- **Automatically generate strong, unique passwords.**
  - That's correct. Password managers can automatically generate strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts, reducing the risk of using weak or reused passwords.
- Eliminate the need for multi-factor authentication.
- **Store passwords securely in an encrypted database.**
  - That's correct. Password managers store your passwords securely in an encrypted database, making it difficult for unauthorized individuals to access your login credentials.

5. Question 5
   True or False: Recent versions of Windows operating systems come with free antivirus software installed.

- **True**
  - That's correct. Recent versions of Windows operating systems come with a free antivirus called Microsoft Defender, which is integrated into the system and provides real-time protection against various types of malware and other security threats.
- False
