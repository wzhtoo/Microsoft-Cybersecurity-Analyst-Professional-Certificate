1.  Question 1
    What is the purpose of endpoint encryption in endpoint security?

- **To protect data stored on endpoints from unauthorized access.**
  - That's correct. Endpoint encryption ensures that data stored on endpoints remains secure even if the device is lost, stolen, or compromised. It encrypts data using strong algorithms, rendering it unreadable without the appropriate decryption key.
- To monitor user behavior and detect insider threats.
- To enforce access controls and prevent unauthorized device connections.
- To block malicious network traffic and prevent cyberattacks.

2. Question 2
   What are the potential disadvantages of network segmentation? Select all that apply.

- **Longer configuration time.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Implementing network segmentation can require additional configuration time as it involves setting up separate segments and defining access controls
- **Higher hardware costs.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Network segmentation may require additional hardware, such as switches or routers, to support the segmentation, which can increase costs.
- More bandwidth consumption.
- Increased latency in network traffic.

3. Question 3
   Which of the following are the key benefits of implementing an intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS)? Select all that apply.

- **Enhanced incident response efficiency.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Another key benefit of implementing an IDPS is enhanced incident response efficiency. By automating the detection and response processes, IDPS reduces the manual effort required for incident response. It provides security teams with valuable insights and actionable information to investigate and remediate security incidents effectively.
- Enhanced network connectivity.
- Data encryption.
- **Early threat detection.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. One of the key benefits of implementing an IDPS is early threat detection. IDPS solutions are designed to detect potential intrusions in real-time or near real-time, allowing organizations to respond swiftly and to mitigate the impact of attacks.

4. Question 4
   Which of the following are valid components of an IDPS? Select all that apply.

- Routers
- **Analyzers**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Analyzers are a vital component of an IDPS. They analyze the data collected by sensors, employing various techniques to identify potential threats. Analyzers play a crucial role in the detection and analysis of network activities for intrusion detection and prevention.
- Firewalls
- **Sensors**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Sensors are one of the key components of an IDPS. They are responsible for capturing and analyzing network traffic, system logs, and other relevant data, providing the necessary information for intrusion detection and prevention.

5. Question 5
   True or False: Firewall rule prioritization does not contribute to the optimization process, and monitoring and logging activities are not important for detecting potential security threats.

- True
- **False**
  - That's correct. Rule prioritization is a crucial aspect of firewall optimization, helping to enhance both security and performance by ensuring the most important rules are applied first.
