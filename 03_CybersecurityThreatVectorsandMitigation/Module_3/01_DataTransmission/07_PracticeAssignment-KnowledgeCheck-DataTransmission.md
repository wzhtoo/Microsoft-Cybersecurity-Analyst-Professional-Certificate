1.  Question 1
    Which of the following are valid IoT threats? Select all that apply.

- Regular firmware updates.
- **Unsecure network services.**
  - That's correct. Many IoT devices communicate using insecure network services and protocols that do not incorporate strong security measures. Attackers can exploit these services to gain unauthorized access to devices and data. These insecure network services are a significant threat as they can provide an entry point for attackers to gain unauthorized access to devices and data.
- **Weak authentication mechanisms.**
  - That's correct. Weak authentication mechanisms, especially default passwords that the user doesnâ€™t change, are a significant threat to IoT devices as malicious threat actors can easily exploit them.
- Strong password policies.

2. Question 2
   What is the purpose of IoT botnets?

- **To launch coordinated attacks.**
  - That's correct. Attackers use IoT botnets to launch coordinated attacks, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The Mirai botnet is a notable example of this.
- To provide network segmentation.
- To enhance device functionality.
- Coin mining.

3. Question 3
   Which of the following are true for APT attacks? Select all that apply.

- APT attacks are usually short-term and random.
- APT attacks aim for quick, immediate damage.
- **APT attacks often exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.**
  - That's correct. APT attacks frequently take advantage of zero-day vulnerabilities to infiltrate their target's system.
- **APT attacks are typically designed to evade detection.**
  - That's correct. APT attacks use advanced evasion techniques to bypass traditional security measures and hide their presence.

4. Question 4
   Why is data encryption an essential feature of a VPN?

- It stores your data for future reference.
- **It ensures your data is unreadable to potential eavesdroppers.**
  - That's correct! Data encryption translates data into a code, so it can only be read by someone with the correct decryption key, ensuring your information is safe from eavesdroppers or attackers.
- It changes your device's IP address.
- It helps to speed up your internet connection.

5. Question 5
   Charlie is sending sensitive data to Alex over the internet. However, unknown to both of them, Quinn intercepted their connection. Quinn was able to receive all the data Charlie sent to Alex and could even alter the data before sending it on to Alex. Based on the scenario above, which attack is Quinn most likely conducting?

- Replay attack
- Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack
- Brute force attack
- **Man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack**
  - That's correct. In a MiTM attack, the attacker can intercept and potentially alter the data being transmitted between two parties, much like what Quinn is doing in this scenario.
