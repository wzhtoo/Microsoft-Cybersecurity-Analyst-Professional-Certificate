1.  Question 1
    Jamie is a remote worker who often uses a neighboring coffee shop's free Wi-Fi to send or receive files and communicate with coworkers. One day, Jamie realized some emails had not been sent and did not appear in the sent folder, while coworkers reported receiving odd emails from Jamie. Which of the following attacks could Jamie be a victim of?

- Data exfiltration
- Brute force attack
- Replay attack
- **Man-in-the-middle attack**
  - That's correct. Given the scenario, a man-in-the-middle attack is likely. This type of attack could occur, especially if Jamie is using an unsecured public Wi-Fi network, which could allow an attacker to intercept and manipulate her communications.

2. Question 2
   Consider a situation where Joey, a bank employee, frequently uses an application to authorize financial transactions. The application requires you to enter a unique passcode sent through email each time you log in. One day, Joey notices multiple unauthorized transactions from the same account, each using the same passcode they had used for a previous legitimate transaction. Based on this scenario, which data transmission threat is most likely being exploited?

- Eavesdropping
- Brute force attack
- Man-in-the-middle attack
- **Replay attack**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. A replay attack involves capturing valid data transmission and retransmitting it, usually for malicious purposes. In this case, the attacker is capturing the valid passcode and reusing it to authorize multiple transactions

3. Question 3
   When choosing a VPN service, what factors should be considered to ensure it meets your specific needs?

- Only the security features of the VPN.
- Just the cost of the service.
- **The cost, security features, server locations, and privacy policy of the VPN.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. All these factors should be considered to ensure the VPN service meets your needs.
- Only the number of server locations.

4. Question 4
   What are some of the prevention strategies that can be effective against advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks? Select all that apply.

- Ignoring unusual network activity as a minor glitch.
- **Regularly updating and patching systems.**
  - That's correct. Regular patching can prevent attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities, which is a common tactic in APT attacks.
- Keeping the entire network connected and without segmentation.
- **Educating users about the dangers of phishing and how to identify suspicious emails.**
  - That's correct. Many APT attacks begin with a phishing email. User education is an important defense against these attacks.

5. Question 5
   Which of the following statements about IoT botnets is correct? Select all that apply.

- IoT devices cannot be attacked easily when they are behind firewalls.
- **IoT botnets are used to carry out distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. IoT botnets are used to carry out DDoS attacks, overwhelming targeted systems with traffic and causing service disruptions
- **The Mirai botnet is an example of an IoT botnet.**
  - Feedback: Thatâ€™s correct. The Mirai botnet is an example of an IoT botnet. It was used in several high-profile DDoS attacks by exploiting vulnerabilities in IoT devices.
- IoT botnets are primarily made up of computing devices like desktops and laptops.

6. Question 6
   True or False: Network segmentation only serves to increase network performance and has no impact on security.

- True
- **False**
  - That's correct. Network segmentation significantly enhances security. If a device in one segment is compromised, the threat is contained within that segment, protecting the other segments from the attack. Performance improvements are a secondary benefit.

7. Question 7
   True or False: Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) can only detect and prevent external attacks on a network.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. IDPS can detect and prevent both external and internal attacks on a network. While external attacks are commonly targeted by hackers outside the network, IDPS is also capable of detecting and preventing insider threats, such as unauthorized access or malicious activities by individuals within the network.

8. Question 8
   True or False: Endpoint security solely focuses on protecting desktop computers and laptops within an organization.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Endpoint security encompasses the protection of various types of endpoints beyond just desktop computers and laptops. It includes securing smartphones, tablets, servers, IoT devices, and other networked devices that serve as entry points to an organization's network. Endpoint security measures aim to protect all types of endpoints from cyber threats and ensure the overall security of an organization's digital infrastructure.

9. Question 9
   Which of the following steps are valid to optimize the firewall? Select all that apply.

- Allow all incoming connections to reduce firewall load.
- Increase the number of firewall rules to improve security.
- **Implement monitoring and logging.**
  - That's correct. Implementing monitoring and logging helps detect potential security threats and facilitates incident response, contributing to the overall effectiveness of a firewall.
- **Regularly update firewall software.**
  - That's correct. Regularly updating firewall software ensures that you have the latest security patches and improvements, maintaining optimal performance and security.

10. Question 10
    Which of the following are the benefits when an organization implements a BYOD policy? Select all that apply.

- **Improved productivity and efficiency.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. BYOD policies can improve productivity and efficiency as employees can work on devices, they are familiar with and comfortable using, enhancing their work performance.
- Increased device standardization and control.
- **Increased employee satisfaction and morale.**
  - That's correct. Implementing a BYOD policy can lead to increased employee satisfaction and morale as they have the flexibility to use their preferred devices for work, enhancing their overall work experience.
- Decreased security risks and data breaches.
