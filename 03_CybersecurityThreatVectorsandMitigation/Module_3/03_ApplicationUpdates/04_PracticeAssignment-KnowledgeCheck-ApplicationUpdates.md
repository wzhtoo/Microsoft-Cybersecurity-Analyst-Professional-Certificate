1.  Question 1
    You've got an email stating that your computer software needs an update, and it includes a link that appears to be genuine. What should be your course of action? Select all that apply.

- Click on the link immediately to update the software.
- **Check the official website or app for any software updates.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Checking the official website or application for updates is the safest way to ensure you're getting a genuine update.
- **Verify the email sender and the link before clicking.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. It's always essential to verify the source of the email and the link it contains before clicking, even if it appears genuine. Cybercriminals often masquerade as legitimate entities to trick you into clicking malicious links.
- Forward the email to your friends to let them know about the software update.

2. Question 2
   In a business organization's office, there are 50 computers. The IT department comes across news of a zero-day vulnerability in a software program they use, and there's currently no patch or fix from the software provider. What actions should this company take? Select all that apply.

- **Inform all employees about the vulnerability and instruct them not to use the software until further notice.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Informing all staff about the situation and instructing them to avoid the software helps to limit potential damage and exposure to the vulnerability.
- Assume the vulnerability won't impact their specific systems and continue using the software.
- Install an older version of the software on all systems as it may not have the vulnerability.
- **Uninstall or disable the software across all systems.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. When there's a known vulnerability with no available patch, uninstalling or disabling the software is a crucial first step to prevent potential exploitation.

3. Question 3
   You're using an older version of an operating system on your computer, and you're ok with it because everything seems to be running smoothly. Which of the following statements are true? Select all that apply.

- **You might be missing out on performance improvements and new features.**
  - That's correct. New versions of operating systems often come with performance improvements and new features that can make your computing experience better.
- **You may not have the latest security patches and updates.**
  - That's correct. Older operating systems may not have the latest security patches and updates, which are crucial for protecting your system against known vulnerabilities and threats.
- You can install newer hardware which will work smoother with this operating system.
- **Your system might be at risk of getting exploited due to unpatched vulnerabilities.**
  - That's correct. If you're using an older version of an operating system, it may contain unpatched vulnerabilities which cybercriminals can exploit.

4. Question 4
   In a corporate environment, employees are permitted to bring their personal devices and access company data through these devices. What potential issues might arise from this practice? Select all that apply.

- **Malware or viruses on an employee's device could potentially infect the company network.**
  - That's correct. If an employee's device is infected with malware or a virus, it could spread to the company network when connected, posing a significant cybersecurity risk.
- The company's internet bandwidth will be exhausted, causing network outages.
- **If a device is lost or stolen, it could lead to unauthorized access to company data.**
  - That's correct. Lost or stolen devices are a significant risk in a BYOD environment. If these devices are not adequately secured, it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive company data.
- Employees will be less productive as they will use their own devices for personal activities.
- **Personal devices might have security vulnerabilities that can expose company data.**
  - That's correct. Personal devices may not have the same level of security as company devices, and this can expose company data to potential threats.

5. Question 5
   True or False: In the context of a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy, it is recommended not to monitor the applications that users install on their personal devices.

- True
- **False**
  - That's correct. Even with a BYOD policy, monitoring the applications installed on devices accessing company data is crucial. This helps to ensure that no malicious or vulnerable applications pose a risk to the company's cybers.
