1.  Question 1
    Which of the following is an example of a public key cryptography algorithm?

- SHA-256
- AES
- **RSA**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. RSA is an example of a public key cryptography algorithm, which uses a pair of keys - one for encryption and one for decryption - and is commonly used for digital signatures and key exchange
- MD5

2. Question 2
   What is the main difference between a digital signature and a message authentication code (MAC)?

- A digital signature is used for key exchange, while a MAC is used for data transfer.
- A digital signature is used for encryption, while a MAC is used for decryption.
- A digital signature provides non-repudiation, while a MAC provides confidentiality.
- **A digital signature is created using a public key, while a MAC is created using a symmetric key.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. A digital signature is created using a public key, while a MAC is created using a symmetric key. Digital signatures are used for verifying the authenticity and integrity of digital documents or messages, while MACs are used for verifying the integrity of data transmitted over a network.

3. Question 3
   Which of the following is an example of a hash function?

- Diffie-Hellman
- RSA
- **SHA-1**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. SHA-1 is an example of a hash function used to generate a fixed-size, unique representation of a variable-size message. It is no longer considered secure and has been replaced by more secure hash functions like SHA-2 and SHA-3.
- AES

4. Question 4
   Which of the following is an example of a digital signature algorithm?

- **RSA**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. RSA is an example of a digital signature algorithm, which uses public key cryptography to provide proof of authenticity and non-repudiation for digital documents or messages.
- SHA-256
- Diffie-Hellman
- HMAC

5. Question 5
   Which of the following is an example of a key exchange algorithm?

- Blowfish
- RC4
- MD5
- **Diffie-Hellman**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Diffie-Hellman is an example of a key exchange algorithm, which allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure communication channel.
