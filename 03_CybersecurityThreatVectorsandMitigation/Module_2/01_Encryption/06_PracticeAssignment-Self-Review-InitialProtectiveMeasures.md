## Assignment

[Assignment ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-threat-vectors-and-mitigation/assignment-submission/NAhrV/self-review-initial-protective-measures/attempt)

In the exercise Initial protective measures, you acted as a cybersecurity consultant for Samâ€™s Scoops, evaluating their security infrastructure and identifying vulnerabilities. Your objective was to recommend initial protective measures to secure Samâ€™s physical machines and user data based on your findings. You reviewed the companyâ€™s security policies, infrastructure, and physical machines, and developed a comprehensive security plan to address the identified vulnerabilities.

Now, itâ€™s time for a self-review to assess your understanding and application of the concepts covered in this exercise.

1.  Question 1
    Given Sam's Scoopsâ€™ current security profile, a system failure can result in the loss of critical business data. Which security policy recommendation can help prevent such incidents?

- Implementing consistent access controls.
- Enforcing periodic password changes.
- **Establishing a data backup and recovery plan.**
  - Correct
    Thatâ€™s correct. A data backup and recovery plan helps protect critical business data by ensuring that copies are regularly created and can be restored in the event of system failure.

2. Question 2
   Which infrastructure recommendation can help Sam's Scoops protect against unauthorized access to their network?

- Securing physical machines adequately.
- Updating to supported operating systems.
- Implementing strong authentication methods.
- **Configuring and maintaining firewalls properly.**
  - Correct
    Thatâ€™s correct. Proper configuration and maintenance of firewalls can help prevent unauthorized access to the network by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic.

3. Question 3
   Which infrastructure recommendation can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive customer information?

- **Implementing strong authentication methods.**
  - Correct
    Thatâ€™s correct. Strong authentication methods, such as multi-factor authentication, can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive customer information.
- Securing physical machines adequately.
- Updating to supported operating systems.
- Configuring and maintaining firewalls properly.
