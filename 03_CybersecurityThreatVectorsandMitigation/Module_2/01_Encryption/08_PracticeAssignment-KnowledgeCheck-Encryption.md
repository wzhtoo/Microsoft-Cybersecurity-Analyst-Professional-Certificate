1.  Question 1
    What is the Caesar cipher encryption method?

- A hashing algorithm used to verify the integrity of data.
- **A substitution cipher that shifts the alphabet a fixed number of places.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption, while asymmetric encryption uses different keys.
- A symmetric encryption method that uses different keys for encryption and decryption.
- An asymmetric encryption method that uses a public-private key pair.

2. Question 2
   What is the difference between AES and DES encryption methods?

- **AES uses a larger key size than DES.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. AES uses a larger key size than DES, making it more secure.
- AES is a block cipher, while DES is a stream cipher.
- AES is an older encryption method than DES.
- DES is more secure than AES.

3. Question 3
   What is SSL/TLS encryption used for?

- To provide users with anonymous browsing capabilities.
- To block unwanted network traffic and prevent DDoS attacks.
- **To secure online transactions and sensitive data exchange.**
  - Correct
    Thatâ€™s correct. SSL/TLS encryption is primarily used to secure online transactions and sensitive data exchange, such as credit card information, login credentials, and personal data.
- To encrypt files and data at rest on a hard drive.

4. Question 4
   How does VPN encryption help secure online communications?

- By providing users with additional network bandwidth.
- **By encrypting network traffic between two or more devices.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. VPN encryption can help secure online communications by encrypting network traffic between two or more devices, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept and access sensitive data.
- By blocking incoming network traffic from unknown sources.
- By providing access to restricted websites and online resources.

5. Question 5
   How does blockchain technology use encryption to ensure security?

- By encrypting all network traffic between nodes.
- By restricting access to the blockchain to authorized users only.
- **By using a public-private key encryption method.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Blockchain technology uses a public-private key encryption method to ensure security.
- By providing users with access to network security tools and software.
