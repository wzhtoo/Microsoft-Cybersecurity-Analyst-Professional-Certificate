1.  Question 1
    Sam wants to set up a system that enables her employees to access the resources they need to do their jobs securely, but she also wants to prevent unauthorized access. Which of the following would be the primary goal of such an identity management system in Sam's business?

- To ensure all employees can access any business-related information at any time.
- To allow employees to change their personal information in the business system whenever they want.
- **To ensure that only authorized individuals can access appropriate resources at the right times and for the right reasons.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The primary goal of Identity Management is to establish a system that ensures the right individuals can access the correct resources at appropriate times and for valid reasons.
- To protect business and employee data from being accessed by third-party applications.

2. Question 2
   Sam uses a variety of software tools to manage inventory, payroll, customer relations, and sales in her ice cream business. She finds it challenging to remember the different passwords for each of these tools. Sheâ€™s considering implementing a new system to make this easier. What would be the main advantage for Sam if she decided to use a Single Sign-On (SSO) system?

- It would provide extra layers of security for Sam by asking for additional verification for each tool.
- It would require Sam to remember multiple passwords for her various accounts.
- It would ensure that Sam's user accounts across all tools cannot be hacked.
- **It would allow Sam to access all her business tools using a single set of credentials.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The key benefit of a Single Sign-On (SSO) system is that it enables users to log into multiple applications or platforms using just one set of credentials. This greatly simplifies the login process and reduces the need to remember multiple usernames and passwords.

3. Question 3
   What is the primary role of Group Policy within an Active Directory framework?

- To enable the dispatch of emails to users.
- To preserve user data.
- **To regulate and manage the operational environment of user accounts and computer accounts.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Group Policy in Active Directory primarily provides a framework for centralized configuration and management of operating systems, applications, and user settings in an Active Directory environment.
- To uphold the optimal performance of the server.

4. Question 4
   Which of the following is the primary function of Azure AD?

- To provide cloud storage for user data.
- **To serve as a cloud-based identity and access management service.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Azure AD is Microsoft's cloud-based identity and access management service. It helps organizations ensure that the right people access the right information.
- To perform vulnerability scanning on the network.
- To host web applications.

5. Question 5
   In the context of Azure Active Directory, what does the term "Federation" refer to?

- The process of performing backups in Azure.
- The process of implementing firewalls and security groups in Azure.
- The process of replicating data across different regions in Azure.
- **The process of establishing trust between two or more domains to allow users to access resources across these domains.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. "Federation" in the context of Azure Active Directory refers to a trust relationship that is set up between two or more domains (which could be in the same or different organizations).
