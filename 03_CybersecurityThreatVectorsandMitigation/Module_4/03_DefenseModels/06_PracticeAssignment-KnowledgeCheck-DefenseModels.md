1.  Question 1
    Sam decides to enhance her company's security system. A cybersecurity consultant recommends implementing the Zero Trust Model. Which of the following implementation scenarios best represents the Zero Trust Model in Sam's business?

- Sam verifies the identity of every user outside the network while all users already inside the network are fully trusted.
- **Sam allows access to the systems only after verifying the identities of all users, irrespective of their location (inside or outside the network).**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! In the Zero Trust Model, trust is never assumed for any user or system, regardless of their location relative to the network perimeter.
- Sam installs a robust firewall system, thereby creating a barrier to external threats while fully trusting all the internal network traffic.
- Sam uses encrypted communication channels for transferring sensitive information, assuming trust only for encrypted channels.

2. Question 2
   Sam hires a cybersecurity team for ongoing security operations and monitoring. Which of the following scenarios best explains the significance of this move in safeguarding her organization?

- The cybersecurity team's job is to install a powerful antivirus software simply, and then they can sit back and relax, as the software will take care of all the threats.
- The cybersecurity team should keep checking for any network breaches periodically, say once a month, and take necessary action only when a threat is detected.
- **The cybersecurity team should constantly monitor and analyze the organization's networks and systems, detect any anomalies or threats, respond to them immediately, and adapt the security measures as needed.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Ongoing security operations and monitoring mean that the cybersecurity team is continuously overseeing the network and systems, detecting, and analyzing any potential threats, responding to them promptly, and constantly adjusting security measures based on the evolving threat landscape.
- The cybersecurity team should focus solely on external threats, as those are the only significant risks to the organization's network and systems.

3. Question 3
   You have been hired to review an organization's security measures related to access to its infrastructure. Which measure would you prioritize?

- Implementing perimeter firewalls.
- Employing one-way hashing algorithms.
- Ensuring data redundancy.
- **Strengthening access controls.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Strengthening access controls such as single sign-on and multi-factor authentication is key when dealing with infrastructure access.

4. Question 4
   You are the lead developer of a new application and are concerned about data security. Which step would you take to ensure the application is secure?

- Implementing network segmentation.
- **Secure application development.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. Securing the application development lifecycle should be your primary concern to ensure the application handles sensitive data appropriately.
- Ensuring geographical dispersal of resources.
- Implementing DDoS protection.

5. Question 5
   As a data security officer, your company's database has just been breached. Which layer of the defense in depth strategy has been compromised?

- Network
- Perimeter
- **Data**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. The Data layer of the defense in depth strategy refers to safeguarding data stored in various locations, including databases. A compromise here would mean unauthorized access to the company's data.
- Physical security
