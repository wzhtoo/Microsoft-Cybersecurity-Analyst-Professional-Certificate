1.  Question 1
    You are the manager of a graphic design team that has been tasked with creating a series of promotional materials for a new product launch. Given the tight deadline, you decide to use generative AI to expedite the design process.

- Which of the following approaches would be the best use of generative AI to meet your objective?
- Rely on generative AI to automate customer support for inquiries about the new product.
- Implement generative AI to generate synthetic datasets for training new machine learning models.
- **Use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to create a variety of realistic images based on textual descriptions provided by the marketing team.**
  - That's correct. GANs are ideal for generating realistic images from textual descriptions, which can save time and resources in the design process.
- Use generative AI to synthesize speech and create an audio advertisement for the new product.

2. Question 2
   As the head of a logistics company facing frequent supply chain disruptions due to unpredictable demand fluctuations, you decide to incorporate generative AI to improve efficiency.

Which of the following best uses generative AI when addressing this challenge?

- **Use generative AI to forecast demand trends and simulate various supply chain scenarios for better planning.**
  - That's correct. Generative AI can analyze data to predict demand and simulate different scenarios, helping to optimize supply chain operations.
- Apply generative AI to automate the recruitment process by analyzing job descriptions and applicant data.

- Implement generative AI to create personalized email marketing campaigns to attract new customers.

- Implement a generative AI system which is costly but the best solution.

3. Question 3
   True or False: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) involve two neural networks, the generator and the discriminator, which work together in an adversarial process to create highly realistic outputs.

- **True**
  - That's correct. The generator creates data, while the discriminator evaluates it, continuously improving the quality of the generated outputs through their adversarial interaction.
- False

4. Question 4
   Generative AI models like GPT and BERT use a mechanism called \***\*\_\_\*\*** to understand and generate contextually relevant text.

- Backpropagation
- Convolution
- Reinforcement learning
- **Self-attention**
  - That's correct. Self-attention allows models to weigh the importance of each word in a sequence relative to all other words, enabling better contextual understanding.

1. Question 5
   As the HR manager of a growing tech company, you are implementing generative AI to streamline the recruitment process. Which strategy best addresses the ethical concerns associated with AI in hiring?

- **Implementing rigorous testing and auditing of the AI system to identify and correct biases in the resume screening process.**
  - That's correct. Regular audits and bias correction ensure the AI does not perpetuate discriminatory practices and promotes fairness in hiring.
- Relying solely on AI-generated candidate evaluations to make hiring decisions.
- Implementing AI to automate administrative tasks like scheduling interviews.
- Using AI to generate personalized email responses to all applicants.
