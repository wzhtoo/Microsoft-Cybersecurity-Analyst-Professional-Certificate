1.  Question 1
    Which of these computing environments is most likely to have the most hardware?

- Commercial cloud-based computing
- Personal computing
- **Traditional commercial computing**
  - Correct! A commercial enterprise is more likely to need more hardware than a private individual, and cloud-based businesses will be more reliant on cloud-based services.

2. Question 2
   Which of the following are examples of endpoints? Select all that apply.

- Windows operating system.
- **Mobile devices**
  - Correct! Mobile devices are the end of a communication channel.
- **Desktops**
  - Correct! Desktops are the end of a communication channel.

3. Question 3
   How can using segregation as a defensive measure better protect your assets?

- Segregation creates more endpoints and confuses a would-be hacker.
- It divides the hackerâ€™s attacks, and so reduces their impact.
- **Segregation means that even if a hacker breaches the network, the scope for damage is limited.**
  - Correct! Segregation does not make your network more unbreachable; it ensures that the surface area for causing damage is reduced if a breach occurs.

4. Question 4
   True or False: The 3-2-1 backup strategy makes your organization less prone to hacking.

- True

- **False**
  - Correct! the 3-2-1 backup is a good policy to ensure you can recover more quickly from a breach. It makes your organization more resilient against ransomware, but it does not make your system less hackable.

1 point 5.
Question 5
Which computing environment would you expect to have the highest start-up costs?

- Cloud computing
- Personal computing
- **Traditional commercial computing**
  - Correct. The traditional approach to commercial computing typically requires significant start-up capital to overcome the initial cost of acquiring the necessary hardware to run a business.
