- Automated and repetitive attacks on a system.
- **Tricking a user to activate malicious code by clicking on it.**
  - That's correct! This code needs to be clicked before it can do harm.

13. Question 13
    Assuming it is only used for one account, which of these passwords would be the most resistant against an attempted attack?

- **HVh#8D!2f7$R**
  - Correct! This password combines a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. It is also 12 characters long.
- sandiego2016!
- FjY123

14. Question 14
    Which of the following are examples of non-volatile memory? Select all that apply:

- RAM
- **Solid State Drive**
  - Correct. Data in a solid-state drive will persist even when the power is removed.
- Hard Disk Drive
  - Correct. Data in a hard disk drive will persist even when the power is removed.

15. Question 15
    Which of the following can be used for processing?

- **CPU**
  - Correct. A CPU is considered the brain, or the part used for processing.
- Monitor
- Keyboard

16. Question 16
    Which of the following definitions best describes a batch operating system?

- An OS that allows multiple users to work in tandem by compartmentalizing each userâ€™s actions and only allowing one user control at any given time.
- **An OS that operates in a timed manner: a unit of time called a quantum is allocated to each task.**
- An OS that connects several dispersed CPUs to execute tasks.

17. Question 17
    A \***\*\_\_\_\_\*\*** is a small piece of code that allows messages and instructions to pass between hardware and software components.

- Internet of things
