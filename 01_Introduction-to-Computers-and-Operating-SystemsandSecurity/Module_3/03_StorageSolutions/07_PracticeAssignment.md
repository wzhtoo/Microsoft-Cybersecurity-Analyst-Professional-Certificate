1.  Question 1
    What type of data structure is used with Blob storage?

- Schema
- Structured
- **Unstructured**
  - Correct! It takes large unstructured data.

2. Question 2
   Imagine that you have a large amount of data that you would like to store in a structured, logical way that makes it easy to locate specific information later. Which of these storage options is best suited for this use case?

- **Data warehouse**
  - Correct! A data warehouse holds data that has been processed beforehand, which means less work needs to be done to prepare it for analysis.
- Data lake
- Blob storage

3. Question 3
   Sam wants to train a machine learning model to predict which ice cream flavors will be the bestsellers on Friday evening. Which steps should she take before training? Select all that apply.

- **Preprocess data.**
  - Correct! To ensure accurate results, Sam will need to clean the data before training to get rid of errors or data that doesnâ€™t belong.
- **Collect data.**
  - Correct! Sam will need to gather historical data that the computer can analyze for patterns
- Test the modelâ€™s predictive skill.

4. Question 4
   Sam has a collection of feedback forms from the customers of Samâ€™s Scoops. She would like to use this data to identify any significant trends in customer opinions. Which data processing technique would she apply to do this?

- Data storage
- **Data visualization**
  - Correct! Data analysis is the practice of transforming raw data into useful information, typically by observing the relationship between data points.
- Data analysis

1 point 5.
Question 5
True or False: Machine learning models can only be trained on numerical data.

- True
- **False**
  - Correct! Machine learning models can handle a variety of data, including words and images.
