1.  Question 1
    You are the data privacy officer for a mid-sized tech company. The CEO wants to build trust with customers by openly communicating how their data is being collected, processed, and shared.

Which principle of Microsoft's approach to data privacy should your company adopt?

- **Transparency**
  - Correct! Transparency involves openly communicating and informing users about how their data is being collected, processed, and shared, which helps in building trust.
- Security
- Control

2. Question 2
   You are the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at a healthcare organization that has recently migrated its data to Microsoft Azure. In the wake of a recent data breach, you need to understand how to respond and what tools can be used to handle data subject requests.

Among Microsoft's resources, which tool should you primarily use to support these needs?

- **The Microsoft Service Trust Portal**
  - Correct! The Microsoft Service Trust Portal provides many resources for understanding compliance and security measures. It includes sections dedicated to Regulations and Standards, a newly introduced Privacy area for guidance on responding to data breaches, and tools for handling Data Subject Requests.
- The Microsoft Trust Center
- The Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle

3. Question 3
   You are a Data Protection Officer (DPO) at a large company using Microsoft's online services to handle sensitive customer data. Recently, your company has decided to switch to another service provider. You are tasked with ensuring that all customer data is securely removed from Microsoft's servers in compliance with data protection laws.

How does Microsoft handle the deletion of customer data after you end the subscription, and what action should you take to expedite the deletion process?

- Microsoft immediately deletes all customer data as soon as the subscription ends, and no further action is needed.
- **Microsoft retains customer data for 90 days in a limited function account and then deletes it, but a request can be made to Microsoft Support for expedited deletion within three days.**
  - Correct! After a subscription ends, Microsoft retains customer data in a limited function account for 90 days to allow the customer to extract the data. However, a DPO can contact Microsoft Support to request expedited de-provisioning, which will delete all user data within three days after entering a lockout code provided by Microsoft.
- Microsoft transfers all customer data to the new service provider as part of its data portability policy, and no further action is needed.

4. Question 4
   Jane is the head of IT security in a medium-sized company that just started using Microsoft Defender for Cloud. She receives a message that the companyâ€™s secure score is relatively low and wants to improve it.

Which of the following steps should she take based on the Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) recommendations from Microsoft Defender for Cloud?

- Jane should ignore the recommendations and manually inspect all servers, databases, and storage resources for potential threats.
- **Jane should review the security recommendations, identify the security misconfigurations and weaknesses, and take actions to implement the recommendations.**
  - Correct! CSPM in Microsoft Defender for Cloud offers continuous assessment of security posture and provides security recommendations that can be implemented to improve secure configurations and increase the secure score.
- Jane should deactivate the Defender CSPM plan as it is creating too many alerts.
