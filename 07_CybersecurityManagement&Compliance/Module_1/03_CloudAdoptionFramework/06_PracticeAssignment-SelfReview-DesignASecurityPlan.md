The Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) and its principles allow you to securely migrate an enterprise to the cloud.

In the exercise Design a Security Plan, you were tasked with assisting GlobalTravel with the migration approach through the Cloud Adoption Framework. Respond to the following questions to make sure that you understood and executed the tasks correctly.

1.  Question 1
    You are advising GlobalTravel on migrating to Azure. The companyâ€™s priority is to bolster the security measures for customer data during the migration.

Which of the following should be your immediate step?

- **Implement Azure security best practices for data, using encryption and Azure Security Center.**
  - Correct! Prioritizing data security using Azure's built-in tools ensures a safer transition. Implementing encryption, such as Azure Storage Service Encryption for data at rest and Azure VPN Gateway for data in transit, safeguards the data.
- Begin migration without reviewing existing security protocols.
- Migrate data without backups.

2. Question 2
   Before starting GlobalTravel's migration, you need to evaluate their digital estate.

What did you prioritize first?

- Moving all data to the cloud without categorization.
- **Documenting and prioritizing applications based on business criticality.**
  - Correct! Understanding and prioritizing applications ensures that vital systems are migrated with care. This step involves assessing the applications in terms of their business value, usage, and dependencies. It is crucial to identify which applications are critical to business operations, which could benefit most from cloud capabilities, and which might need redesigning for the cloud.
- Counting the number of servers.

3. Question 3
   After assessing the skills readiness, you realized there are significant knowledge gaps in Azure proficiency.

- What is your next move?
- Only consider hiring new talent.
- Ignore the gaps and continue with the migration.
- **Develop a tailored training plan based on the assessment results.**
  - Correct! Addressing skill gaps with tailored training ensures a smoother transition to the cloud. Developing a training plan that's based on the specific needs and skill gaps identified ensures that the team is adequately prepared for the migration and subsequent management of Azure resources. This approach should include Azure-specific modules on cloud architecture, security, management, and best practices.

4.  Question 4
    You need to assign roles to the team members for the Azure migration.

Who would you likely assign to implement cloud governance?

- Jane Doe (Senior DevOps Engineer)
- Jeremy Thompson (Lead Developer)
- **Bob Gray (Security Officer)**
  - Correct! A security officer would have the expertise needed for governance roles in a cloud migration. As a Security Officer, Bob likely possesses knowledge in risk assessment, security best practices, compliance requirements, and policy development. These skills are essential for implementing cloud governance, which involves establishing and enforcing policies to manage and secure cloud resources effectively.
