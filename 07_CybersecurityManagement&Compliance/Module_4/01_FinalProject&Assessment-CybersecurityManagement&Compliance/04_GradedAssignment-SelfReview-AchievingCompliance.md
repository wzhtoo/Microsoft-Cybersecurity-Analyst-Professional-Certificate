[Assignment ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cybersecurity-management-and-compliance/assignment-submission/U0dkX/self-review-achieving-compliance/attempt)

In the previous exercise, you were directed to write a strategy document for a business called NexaGlobal Ltd. This document should detail the tools and techniques that the company can use to maintain data integrity while also attaining compliance with laws and standards. Now, itâ€™s time for you to evaluate your understanding of the exercise and the concepts applied to it.

1.  Question 1
    Alex, an IT manager at NexaGlobal Ltd., is reviewing the new digital transformation strategy document that focuses on leveraging Microsoft Azure's security solutions. He must ensure that the company's data integrity and compliance with international standards are maintained. After studying the strategy, Alex faces a scenario where he needs to decide the best course of action. Which of the following actions should Alex prioritize to align with the company's new strategy?

- **Prioritize deploying Azure Active Directory (AAD) as the primary identity provider and enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users.**
  - That's correct. The strategy document specifically recommends deploying AAD and enforcing MFA, focusing on centralized identity management and enhanced security.
- Focus on training programs exclusively on disaster recovery protocols, ignoring other aspects like MFA and identity management.
- Implement an external, third-party identity provider, considering it might offer more flexibility than Azure Active Directory (AAD).

2. Question 2
   NexaGlobal Ltd. is in the process of adopting the Azure Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF) as part of its cloud transformation strategy. Sarah, the Cloud Strategy Director, needs to make a decision regarding the initial steps of implementation. Considering the guidelines of the Azure CAF and the company's goal for a robust and agile cloud strategy, which of the following actions should Sarah prioritize?

- Implement Azure CAF without any initial assessments, assuming the company's current strategy is already aligned with Azure's best practices.
- **Conduct a comprehensive assessment using Azure CAF to align the company's cloud strategy with Azure's best practices in security, scalability, and performance.**
  - That's correct. The Azure CAF is designed to guide organizations through the complexities of cloud transformation, and a thorough assessment is crucial for aligning NexaGlobal Ltd.'s strategy with the frameworkâ€™s best practices.
- Focus solely on scaling the cloud infrastructure rapidly, disregarding other aspects of the Azure CAF to achieve quick results.

3. Question 3
   As the Data Manager at NexaGlobal Ltd., Emma is tasked with enhancing the company's data management processes using Azure tools. With the recent focus on adopting Azure Data Factory and Azure Policy, she must decide on an immediate action that aligns with the company's strategy for efficient, secure, and compliant data management. Which of the following actions should Emma prioritize?

- **Adopt Azure Data Factory as the primary tool for orchestrating extract, transform, and load (ETL) processes while simultaneously implementing Azure Policy to ensure data management compliance.**
  - That's correct. Adopting Azure Data Factory will enhance ETL processes, and implementing Azure Policy concurrently will ensure that data management complies with organizational standards and regulatory mandates, aligning with the company's strategic goals.
- Prioritize exclusive training for the team on Azure Data Factory, neglecting Azure Policy understanding and implementation.
- Implement Azure Policy first to define data management rules, delaying the adoption of Azure Data Factory to focus on policy development.

4. Question 4
   As the head of IT operations at NexaGlobal Ltd., Carlos is responsible for enhancing the company's data availability and continuity using Azure services. The company is expanding its operations globally, and Carlos needs to make a strategic decision to ensure robust data backup and minimal operational interruption. Which of the following actions should Carlos prioritize, in line with the company's objectives?

- Focus solely on drafting a comprehensive uptime service level agreement (SLA) without implementing any actual Azure Geo-Replication services, assuming that the SLA alone will ensure data availability.
- **Implement Azure's Geo-Replication services to mirror data across multiple regions and draft an uptime SLA that reflects the redundancy provided by these services.**
  - That's correct. Implementing Geo-Replication services provides practical backup and minimizes operational interruptions, while a well-drafted SLA sets clear and realistic expectations regarding service availability, aligning with the company's global operational needs.
- Rely exclusively on Azure's internal disaster recovery mechanisms, assuming they will automatically provide optimal performance for international operations without additional strategic planning.

5. Question 5
   Mia, the Compliance Officer at NexaGlobal Ltd., is tasked with ensuring the company's cloud architecture and IT governance align with various compliance standards using Azure tools. With the introduction of Azure Compliance Manager, Azure Blueprints, and the COBIT framework, Mia needs to decide the most effective strategy to maintain continuous compliance. Which of the following actions should Mia prioritize to meet this objective?

- Use Azure Blueprints to codify the compliance requirements of ISO 27001 into the company's cloud architecture and regularly use Azure Compliance Manager for compliance assessments.
- **Integrate the principles of the COBIT framework with Azure Blueprints for compliant IT deployments and utilize Azure Compliance Manager to ensure ongoing alignment with ISMA and ISO 27001 standards.**
  - That's correct. This comprehensive approach leverages Azure Blueprints to ensure compliant deployments, aligns with the COBIT framework for IT governance, and uses Azure Compliance Manager for continuous assessment, covering all aspects of compliance management effectively.
- Focus exclusively on implementing the COBIT framework for IT governance, disregarding the use of Azure Compliance Manager and Azure Blueprints.

6. Question 6
   As the Chief Security Officer at NexaGlobal Ltd., Jordan is tasked with implementing an effective strategy to manage and mitigate insider risks using Azure's security tools. With a range of tools available, Jordan needs to decide which combination of tools and strategies will most effectively address the unique challenges of insider threats. Which of the following actions should Jordan prioritize to ensure comprehensive insider risk management?

- Rely solely on Microsoft Defender for Identity for its advanced threat detection capabilities, neglecting other tools and strategies focused on insider risks.
- **Utilize a combination of Azure's Insider Risk Management, Microsoft Defender for Identity, Microsoft Purview Information Protection, and Office 365 Communication Compliance to ensure a holistic approach to insider risk.**
  - That's correct. This combination covers continuous monitoring, data integration, threat detection, information protection, and communication compliance, addressing the various facets of insider risk management effectively.
- Implement Azure Active Directory and Conditional Access as the primary tools, assuming they will suffice for all aspects of insider risk management.

7. Question 7
   As the Data Protection Officer at NexaGlobal Ltd., Isabella is responsible for implementing a comprehensive information protection and data lifecycle strategy using Azure services. With the introduction of Azure Information Protection (AIP) and Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management, Isabella must choose the best approach to ensure efficient, secure, and compliant data management. Which of the following actions should Isabella prioritize?

- Focus primarily on user education using AIP's real-time recommendations, while deprioritizing the implementation of data classification and lifecycle policies.
- **Initiate data classification and protection policies using Azure Information Protection, and adopt Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management for data lifecycle orchestration, including compliance and cost optimization.**
  - That's correct. This approach ensures comprehensive data management by combining the benefits of Azure Information Protection for data classification and protection, and Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management for effective lifecycle policies and cost optimization, meeting NexaGlobal Ltd.â€™s diverse data management needs.
- Implement Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management strictly for cost optimization, disregarding the importance of compliance and data protection aspects.
