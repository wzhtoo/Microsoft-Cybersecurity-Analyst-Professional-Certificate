How can Sophia ensure that the Microsoft Azure security configurations in their cloud environment align with the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks?

- Sophia should rely on the Azure Security Center.

- Sophia should contact the Center for Internet Security directly to manually implement benchmarks.

- Sophia should use Azure settings since they are already optimized for all compliance standards.

- **Sophia should deploy the Azure Blueprint specifically designed for the CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark.**
  - Correct! The Azure Blueprint for the CIS Azure Foundations Benchmark assists in deploying policies compliant with the benchmark recommendations.

2. Question 2
   True or False: When it comes to migrating applications to Microsoft Azure, the age, origin, and underlying technology of the applications have no bearing on their risk levels, and only the data they handle (like customer information) needs to be evaluated for risk.

- True
- **False**

4. Question 4
   Julia is a Records Management Specialist at a large corporation. Recently, the company faced an internal audit issue regarding the improper handling of sensitive documents. To mitigate this, Julia wants to use a tool that can automatically label content as a record, set up specific retention and deletion policies for it, and ensure that the retention periods of the labels can't be changed once applied.

Which of the following tools and strategies should Julia adopt for this requirement?

- **Use Microsoft Purview to label content as a record and utilize regulatory record labels for stricter controls.**
  - Correct! Microsoft Purview allows content to be labeled as a record, and using regulatory record labels adds more controls, such as preventing the removal of the label and ensuring retention periods can't be shortened.
