1.  Question 1
    As an IT security manager, Sophia is leading her team in implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance with ISO 27001 to ensure data security. They have just completed a risk assessment and are deciding on the appropriate controls to implement. One of the identified risks is unauthorized access to sensitive customer data during transmission.

Which of the following steps should Sophia and her team prioritize to address this risk effectively?

- Establish robust Physical and Environmental Security controls around the companyâ€™s server rooms.
- Focus on Human Resource Security by ensuring all employees and contractors are aware of their security responsibilities.
- **Implement Communications Security controls, such as encryption during data transmission.**

2. Question 2
   True or False: An organization utilizing Microsoftâ€™s Office 365 services doesnâ€™t need to worry about compliance with information security standards as Microsoftâ€™s adherence to ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27017 ensures complete compliance on the part of the user organization.

4. Question 4
   As an Azure administrator, you are tasked with setting up the Azure environment to maintain compliance with ISO standards during your organization's move to the cloud. You are contemplating whether to use Azure Blueprints or ARM templates to ensure that every deployment within the scope adheres to the defined guidelines, and the setup allows for enhanced tracking and auditing of the deployments.

Which of the following approaches would be the most suitable to achieve the requirements stated above?

- Implement both Azure Blueprints and ARM templates independently, leveraging Blueprints for environment setup and ARM templates for defining infrastructure.
- Implement ARM templates as they offer a declarative syntax to define the infrastructure and its configurations, making the infrastructure easily replicable and reliable.
- **Implement Azure Blueprints to enforce specific behaviors and configurations, apply resource locking and preserve relationships between blueprint definitions and assignments for enhanced tracking and auditing.**

5. Question 5
   True or False: Azure Blueprints and ARM templates serve the same role in Azure deployment and management, and organizations should choose to implement either Azure Blueprints or ARM templates based on their specific needs and requirements.

- True
- **False**
