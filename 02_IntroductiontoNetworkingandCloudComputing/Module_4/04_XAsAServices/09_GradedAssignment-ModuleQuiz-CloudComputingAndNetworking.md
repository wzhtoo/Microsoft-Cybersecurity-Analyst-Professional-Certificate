1.  Question 1
    True or false: Microsoft has its very own cloud platform called Azure, with several services, including virtual machines, storage, network, security services, and many more.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Azure is a scalable and flexible cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services like computing resources, storage, networking, and security services.
- False

2. Question 2
   Identify two advantages of cloud computing for large businesses.

You control all the security around the hardware

- Easy to setup
- **Disaster recovery**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Cloud computing provides built-in disaster recovery options, ensuring that data is backed up and secure in case of a disaster or system failure.
- **Improved collaboration**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! By allowing multiple users to access and work on the same data and applications simultaneously, cloud computing makes it easier for teams to collaborate on projects and share information in real time without the need for constant email exchanges.

3. Question 3
   Within a virtual server environment, type 1 hypervisors run directly on the physical hardware, and theyâ€™re called bare metal. What is the type 2 hypervisor known as?

- Cloud
- Remote
- **Hosted**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Hosted hypervisors run on top of an existing operating system.

4. Question 4
   What virtual machine type is best-suited to real-time big data processing and data analytics?

- **Memory-optimized**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! These VMs have a higher proportion of memory resources relative to CPU and storage. This makes them suitable for memory-intensive applications like large in-memory databases, relational databases, real-time big data processing, data analytics, business intelligence, and large-scale graph databases.
- General purpose
- Compute-optimized

5. Question 5
   What cloud capability can learn from data by identifying patterns within that data to determine trends?

- Servers
- **Machine learning (ML)**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! ML algorithms learn from data by building mathematical models to make predictions. For example, ML can be used to identify patterns in large datasets, such as customer behavior or stock market trends. With ML, machines can learn to make decisions on their own and become smarter over time.
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)

6. Question 6
   True or false: Reactive machines is the simplest type of AI that is designed to react to specific inputs and perform specific tasks.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Reactive machines are the simplest AI type they are limited in their capabilities but are effective at performing specific tasks. General AI is theoretical in that it could be capable of performing learning and reasoning.
- False

7. Question 7
   When purchasing hardware or services a business can choose to pay everything upfront or spread the cost over a period of time. What cost models explain these methods of expenditure? Select all that apply.

- Loan
- Top up
- **Capex**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Capex is spending the money upfront, so you own the hardware from the day of purchase.
- **Opex**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Opex allows a business to spread the cost of a service or hardware across a period of time.

8. Question 8
   Microsoft can provide many different XaaS solutions. Which Microsoft products are classified as IaaS, PaaS or SaaS? Select all that apply.

- Microsoft 365 is PaaS
- **Microsoft Azure is PaaS, IaaS or SaaS**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Microsoft Azure can provide both PaaS and IaaS but it is also hosting Microsoft SaaS products like Microsoft 365.
- **Microsoft Teams is SaaS**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Microsoft Teams is an example of SaaS providing a communication service.
- **Microsoft 365 is SaaS**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Microsoft 365 is an example of SaaS providing a suite of productivity applications like Microsoft Excel.

9. Question 9
   True or false: SaaS is deemed the most complete cloud offering, with the least amount of responsibility for the customer.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! SaaS is the most complete cloud offering and requires the least amount of responsibility from the customer.
- False

10. Question 10
    Before a business implements a SaaS solution, what critical factor do they have to consider to assure the SaaS solution can be used?

- Wi-Fi connectivity
- Operating system
- **Bandwidth**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! As SaaS solutions are not local to a companyâ€™s devices but provided across the Internet, sufficient bandwidth is essential to get access to SaaS solutions.
- Server hardware
