In the
Cloud transformation exercise
, you explored how Sam's Scoops can use Cloud technologies to overcome its IT infrastructure limitations. Cloud transformation is the process of migrating an organization's IT infrastructure, applications, and data to the Cloud. In Sam's case, this means moving her IT infrastructure to the Cloud to reduce costs, increase scalability and reliability, and improve customer engagement. You were tasked to brainstorm and come up with at least two possible Cloud solutions that Sam can implement to address her business challenges.
