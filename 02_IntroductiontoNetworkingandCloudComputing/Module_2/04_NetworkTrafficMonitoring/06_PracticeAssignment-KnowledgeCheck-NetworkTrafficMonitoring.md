1.  Question 1
    If the recursive DNS server cannot resolve your DNS query, what server does it goes to next?

- Authoritative DNS server
- Top-level DNS server
- **Root domain server**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! It will first ask one of 13 root servers whether they know the answer.

2. Question 2
   What type of DNS attack gives the user false DNS server details, pointing them toward the wrong DNS server?

- **DNS hijacking**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The attacker sends the wrong DNS settings to the victim, usually by a DHCP server under the attackerâ€™s control.
- DNS tunneling
- DNS flood attack

3. Question 3
   True or False: Network traffic monitoring involves packet capturing or flow analysis as data sources.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Either of these two processes can be used to monitor traffic on the network.
- False

4. Question 4
   Which metrics are used to track network performance and health? Select all that apply.

- **Bandwidth usage**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! This is a network performance measurement, measuring the peaks and troughs of bandwidth usage.
- **Packet loss**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! This measures network performance, determining how reliable the network is at moving packets from end to end.
- **Latency**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! This is a network performance measurement, measuring the round trip time (RTT) of the packets.
- Speed

5. Question 5
   What important headings are present in a log file? Select all that apply.

- **Log level**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! This tells us how important the event is.
- Log answer
- **Event description**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! This gives you a short description of what happened.
- **Timestamp**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A timestamp is the most important part of a log file because it determines when the event happened.
