1.  Question 1
    What is the purpose of the application layer in the OSI model?

- To transmit data over a network
- To control the flow of data
- To manage network traffic
- **To provide end-user services**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The application layer is responsible for providing services directly to the end-users, such as file transfers, email, and other services

2. Question 2
   What layer of the OSI model is responsible for converting data into a format that can be transmitted over a network?

- Transport layer
- Application layer
- Session layer
- **Presentation layer**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The presentation layer converts data into a usable format for the receiving application. Then applications can communicate with each other with this data or simply present it to the end user. The presentation layer establishes a common format for the data so that it can be understood by both the sender and the receiver, regardless of the device or system they are using.

3. Question 3
   Which layer of the TCP/IP model is responsible for addressing and routing?

- Transport layer
- Network access layer
- **Internet layer**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The Internet layer is responsible for addressing and routing data packets between networks.
- Application layer

4. Question 4
   Which layer of the TCP/IP model is responsible for establishing a connection between two devices on the same network?

- Transport layer
- Internet layer
- Application layer
- **Network access or data link layer**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! This layer is responsible for establishing a connection between two devices on the same network, and transmitting and receiving data packets.

5. Question 5
   What does TCP in the TCP/IP model stand for?

- Telecommunication & Internet Protocol
- Telecommunication Control Protocol
- **Transmission Control Protocol**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
- Transport Control Protocol
