1.  Question 1
    What is used to identify the network and the host portion of an IPv4 address?

- Prefix
- **Subnet mask**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A subnet mask is used to identify the network and the hosts within an IPv4 address.
- IP default gateway

1 point 2.
Question 2
What three different traffic types does IPv6 use? Select all that apply.

- Broadcast
- **Anycast**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Anycast is 1 to nearest.
- Unicast
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Unicast is 1 to 1.
- Multicast
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Multicast is 1 to many.

3. Question 3
   What subnet mask identifies a class A address?

- **255.0.0.0**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A class A addresses only have the first octet fixed as identified by 255, this type of address is used on large networks.
- 255.255.255.0
- 255.255.0.0

4. Question 4
   True or False: Dynamic IP address assignment commonly known as the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, only supported by IPv4.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! DHCP supports both IPv4 and IPv6.

5. Question 5
   Which of the following statements about IP addresses are true? Select all that apply.

- **IPv4 can have a maximum of 4.3 billion addresses**
  - That's correct! IPv4 addresses are 32 bits long, which allows for 2^32 unique addresses, amounting to approximately 4.3 billion possible unique addresses.
- **IPv6 can have a maximum of 2^128 addresses.**

  - That's correct! IPv6 addresses are 128 bits long, leading to 2^128 possible addresses, or about 340 undecillion, significantly increasing the address space compared to IPv4.

- An IP address in IPv4 has 4 parts
  - That's correct! An IPv4 address is divided into four octets, represented in decimal format and separated by periods, making up a total of four parts to identify a network and a host on that network.
- IPv4 addresses can be shortened by removing leading zeros and using double colons (::).
