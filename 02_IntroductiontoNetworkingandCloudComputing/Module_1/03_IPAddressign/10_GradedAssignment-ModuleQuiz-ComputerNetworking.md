1.  Question 1
    True or False: A PAN is used to cover entire countries.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A PAN is used to only cover a small personal area. A WAN is used to cover entire countries.

2. Question 2
   The Mesh topology can be expensive to set up, but what is an advantage of this topology type?

- **Multiple paths**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Mesh topologies have lots of paths, so if one path fails data can move through another.
- Single path
- Data travels in one direction

3. Question 3
   True or False: The bus topology is less common today because older hubs on networks are being replaced with switches and routers.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The star topology is replacing the older bus topology on many networks today.
- False

4. Question 4
   True or False: A WLAN provides greater mobility, flexibility and has no security risks.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A WLAN does have great mobility and flexibility but does have security risks.

5. Question 5
   IPv4 uses decimal numbers and \***\*\_\*\***are used for IPv6.

- Binary numbers
- **Hexadecimal**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! IPv6 uses Hexadecimal 0-9 and A-F to represent its 128-bit address.
- Decimal numbers

6. Question 6
   True or False: Subnets masks are used to identify routers on a network.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The subnet mask identifies the network and the hosts portions of a IPv4 address.

7. Question 7
   IPv6 addresses are longer than IPv4, what else is different between the two IP address variations? Select all that apply.

- **IPv6 has built-in security**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! IPv6 has IPSEC built in for extra protection.
- IPv6 addresses cannot be assigned manually.
- **IPv6 does not support Broadcast traffic**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! IPv6 supports unicast, multicast and anycast not broadcast.
- IPv6 does not support DHCP

8. Question 8
   What is the main purpose of an IP address in a network?

- To order and verify data transmission.
- **To identify and locate devices on the network.**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! IP addresses are used to identify and locate devices on a network.
- To route data across the internet.

9. Question 9
   What does an IP default gateway identify?

- A printer
- A path
- A network
- **A router**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A default gateway identifies a router that can route traffic to other networks.

10. Question 10
    The subnet mask 255.0.0.0 is for what class of network?

- B
- **A**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! It is a class A address which is the largest IPv4 address.
- C
