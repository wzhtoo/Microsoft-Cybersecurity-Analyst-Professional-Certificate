1.  Question 1
    What network type connects devices in a small area like a home or office?

- WAN (wide area network)
- PAN (personal area network)
- **LAN (local area network)**
  - That's correct! A LAN connects devices in a small area, and you can share devices like laptops, printers and an internet connection in a LAN.

2. Question 2
   Wireless local area networks (WLANs) have many advantages, and being flexible is just one, but what are the drawbacks of this network type?

- High installation costs and difficulty to install
- Supports very few users and devices
- **Limited range and security risks**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! WLANs can only cover limited distances and the signal is accessible to anyone which creates a security risk.

3. Question 3
   A network topology determines how devices are connected and how data travels. What network topology is created when a switch is used to connect multiple devices?

- A ring topology
- **A star topology**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Every device connects through a switch which creates a star network
- A bus topology
- A tree topology

4. Question 4
   True or False: A physical topology focuses on data paths across a network.

- True
- **False**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A physical topology refers to the actual layout and physical connection of network devices.

5. Question 5
   During the data transmission process packets are sent over the network in what format?

- As headers
- **As frames**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A frame is sent over the network and all the packet information is included inside that frame.
- As packets
