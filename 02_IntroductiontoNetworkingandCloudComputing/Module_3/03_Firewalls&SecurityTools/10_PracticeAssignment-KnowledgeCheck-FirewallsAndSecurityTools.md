1.  Question 1
    What firewall zone can be assigned a trust level of 100?

- Internet, outside
- DMZ
- **Private, inside network**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The private inside network is typically a trusted zone on the firewall.

2. Question 2
   What firewall type checks the status of TCP connections before data is exchanged?

- Proxy server
- **Circuit-level**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Circuit-level firewalls check that connections are valid before allowing data to pass. This can include checking source and destination addresses.
- Packet-filtering
- Stateful

3. Question 3
   Identify some of the most common network attacks. Select all that apply.

- Ransomware
- **MITM**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks are common network attacks in which an attacker intercepts and alters the communication between two parties.
- **DoS and DDoS**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Denial-of-Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are common network attacks aimed at disrupting the normal functioning of a network or website.
- Phishing

4. Question 4
   Some firewall threats are within your control to prevent them from happening. Identify all such threats below. Select all that apply.

- Malicious insider
- **Lack of documentation**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Poor documentation can prevent changes from being made to the firewall or prevent understanding of how the device works.
- **Outdated firewall software**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Without software updates, a firewall could be vulnerable to attack.
- DDoS attack

5. Question 5
   True or False: Next-generation firewalls (NGFW) combine many functions of the firewall types and can perform deep packet inspection.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Next-generation firewalls combine the features and functions of previous firewall types but can go deeper into the packet.
- False
