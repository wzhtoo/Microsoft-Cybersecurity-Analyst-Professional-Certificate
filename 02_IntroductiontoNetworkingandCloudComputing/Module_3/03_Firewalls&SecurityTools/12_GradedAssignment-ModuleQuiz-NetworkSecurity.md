[Assignment ðŸ”—](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-networking-and-cloud-computing/assignment-submission/UbFJz/module-quiz-network-security/attempt)

1.  Question 1
    What client-server working model allows clients to receive updates on specific events but does not allow clients to send requests?

- Peer-to-peer model (P2P)
- Request-response model
- **Publish-subscribe model**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Clients subscribe to events and receive data whenever the server publishes updates.

2. Question 2
   Different components, including source and destination IP addresses, protocols and ports are used to form firewall **\_\_\_**.

- Blockages
- **Rules**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Different components are used to form firewall rules.
- Access
- Authorization

3. Question 3
   True or False: Contemporary firewalls evolved from the very first type of firewall, the packet-filtering firewall.

- **True**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Packet-filtering firewalls were the first type of firewall, relying on a list of permit and deny statements.
- False

4. Question 4
   A \***\*\_\_\_\_\*\*** attack involves intercepting communication between two parties and relaying information between them so they are unaware of the attack.

- **Man-in-the-middle**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A man-in-the-middle attack involves the theft of data between two unaware parties.
- Backdoors
- IP spoofing
- Eavesdropping

5. Question 5
   What network analysis procedure involves testing users by sending fake or suspicious emails?

- **Penetration testing**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! You can test how well your network will react to attacks by testing devices and assessing how users react.
- Change control
- Continuous monitoring

6. Question 6
   A man in the middle (MITM) attack is formed by using which two attacks together?

- Spreading malware
- Cracking a password
- **Sniffing**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Sniffing involves monitoring and capturing the data packets transmitted between network devices and it is one of the attack types used in a MITM attack.
- **Spoofing**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Spoofing involves manipulating data packets to impersonate another device or user and it is one of the attack types used in a MITM attack.

7. Question 7
   Guest access is the lowest authorization tier, but what other tiers have the highest authorization level to manage the system? Select all that apply.

- **Administrator access**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Administrator access is typically used to manage users and configure system settings.
- User access
- **Superuser access**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! Superuser access is typically used for maintaining and securing a system.
- Conditional access

8. Question 8
   Identify types of authorization protocols. Select all that apply.

- **TACACS+**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! TACACS+ can authenticate and authorize users giving them access to different resources around the network.
- **RADIUS**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! RADIUS can authenticate and authorize users giving them access to different resources around the network.
- TLS
- **LDAP**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! LDAP can authenticate and authorize users giving them access to different resources around the network.

9. Question 9
   What steps are involved in the DHCP IP address assignment, and in what order? Select all that apply.

- **The second two steps are DHCP request and then DHCP acknowledgement**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The order of DHCP is DHCP discover, offer, request, and acknowledgement.
- The second two steps are DHCP discover, then DHCP offer
- **The first two steps are DHCP discover, then DHCP offer**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! The order of DHCP is DHCP discover, offer, request, and acknowledgement.
- The first two steps are DHCP request, then DHCP acknowledgement

10. Question 10
    When a router is in the way of a DHCP request, a DHCP \_\_\_\_ is needed to forward the request to the DHCP server.

- Client
- Passer
- **Relay**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A DHCP relay is needed to forward the DHCP request to where the DHCP server resides.
- Server
