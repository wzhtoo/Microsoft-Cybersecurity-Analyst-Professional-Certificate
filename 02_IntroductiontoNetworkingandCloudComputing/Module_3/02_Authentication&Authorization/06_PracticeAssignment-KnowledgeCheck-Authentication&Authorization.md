1.  Question 1
    What is the difference between authentication and authorization?

- Authentication is the process of granting access to resources based on the user's identity, while authorization is the process of verifying the identity of a user
- Authentication and authorization have no relation to each other
- Authentication and authorization are the same thing
- **Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of granting access to resources based on the user's identity.**
  - That‚Äôs correct! Authentication and authorization are two distinct processes. Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, while authorization is the process of granting access to resources based on the user's identity.

2. Question 2
   What do the terms ‚ÄúGuest access‚Äù, ‚ÄúUser access‚Äù, ‚ÄúAdmin access‚Äù refer to?

- Authentication protocol
- Access control
- **Tiers of authorization**
  - That‚Äôs correct. Guest access, user access, and admin access are different tiers of authorization. Guest access is the lowest tier, user access is a higher tier, and admin access is the highest tier. Each tier provides access to different levels of resources and functionality, with admin access having the most privileges.
- Authorization protocol

3. Question 3
   True or False: An Intranet can work without an internet connection.

- **True**
  - That‚Äôs correct. An intranet is a private network an organization uses to share information and resources among its employees. It can function without an internet connection, as it is self-contained and does not require access to external networks or resources.
- False

4. Question 4
   Which of the following are valid security protocols for wireless routers? Select all that apply.

- WES
- **WPA2**
  - That‚Äôs correct. WPA2 is a valid security protocol for wireless routers. It is a more secure alternative to WPA.
- **WEP**
- RSA

5. Question 5
   In a hospital, there is a collection of patient records. Nurses have access to some of these files, but doctors can access all of the files. And Human Resource staff cannot access any of the files.

Within this scenario which of the following authorization models is being used?

- MAC
- DAC
- **RBAC**
  - That‚Äôs correct. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is an access control model that uses roles to determine access control decisions. In this scenario, nurses have access to some files, doctors have access to all files, and HR people cannot access any files. This is an example of RBAC, where access control decisions are based on the roles of the users.
- ABAC
