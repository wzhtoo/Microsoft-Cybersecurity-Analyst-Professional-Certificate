1.  Question 1
    True or False: DHCP is a protocol that assigns IP addresses and other network configuration settings to devices on a network.

- **True**
  - ddresses and other network configuration settings automatically to devices on a network.
- False

2. Question 2
   What is a server in client-server networking?

- A computer that requests services from another computer
- A device that controls access to the internet
- **A computer that provides services to other computers**
  - Thatâ€™s correct! A server is a computer that provides services to other computers in a client-server network.
- A computer that processes and stores data locally

3. Question 3
   What is the role of VPN in remote access?

- **To enhance the security of the connection**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. VPN is used for remote access to the network and also to enhance the security of remote access connections.
- To provide physical access to the network.
- To speed up the connection speed
- To block remote access

4. Question 4
   Which of the following are the purposes of using DHCP? Select all that apply.

- **Simplifying network management**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. DHCP simplifies network management by providing a centralized control point for IP address assignment and reducing the administrative overhead associated with manual configuration.
- **Avoid IP address conflicts**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. DHCP can prevent IP address conflicts by centrally managing IP address assignments and ensuring that no two devices on the network are assigned the same IP address.
- Increasing network security
- **Automate the IP address assignment process**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. DHCP automates the process of assigning IP addresses to devices on a network, eliminating the need for manual configuration and reducing the potential for errors.

5. Question 5
   What type of server model is it when a device can act as both a client and a server?

- Request-response
- None of the above
- **Peer-to-peer**
  - Thatâ€™s correct. In a peer-to-peer (P2P) client-server model, devices can act as both clients and servers, allowing them to share files and resources with other devices on the network.
- Publish-subscribe
